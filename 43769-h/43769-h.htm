<h2>CHAPTER I<br />
<br />
A LITTLE GIRL</h2>

<p>"Oh, what is it, grandad! Why is Kirsty ringing
two bells and oh, what is he saying?"</p>

<p>Grandfather Carrick had come out of his cottage
and stood in the small yard place that a young oak had
nearly filled with a carpet of leaves. He was a
medium-sized man with reddish hair streaked with
white, and a spare reddish beard, rather ragged,
bright blue eyes and a nose <i>retrouss√©</i> at the best, but
in moments of temper or disdain it turned almost upside
down, as now.</p>

<p>"What is he sayin'. Well, it's a dirty black lee!
Lord Cornwallis isn't the man to give in to a rabble
of tatterdemalions with not a shoe to their feet an'
hardly a rag to their back! By the beard of St.
Patrick they're all rags!" and he gave an insolent
laugh! "It's a black lee, I tell you!"</p>

<p>He turned and went in the door with a derisive
snort. Daffodil stood irresolute. Kirsty was still
ringing his two bells and now people were coming
out to question. The street was a rather winding
lane with the houses set any way, and very primitive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
they were, built of logs, some of them filled in with
rude mortar and thatched with straw.</p>

<p>Then Nelly Mullin came flying along, a bright, dark-haired,
rosy-cheeked woman, with a shawl about her
shoulders. She caught up the child and kissed her
rapturously.</p>

<p>"Oh, isn't it full grand!" she cried. "Cornwallis
has surrendered to General Washington! Our folks
caught him in a trap. An' now the men folks will
come home, my man an' your father, Dilly. Thank
the Saints there wasna a big battle. Rin tell your
mither!"</p>

<p>"But grandad said it was a&mdash;a lee!" and the child
gave a questioning look.</p>

<p>"Lie indeed!" she laughed merrily. "They wouldna
be sending all over the country such blessed news
if it was na true. Clear from Yorktown an' their
Cornwallis was the biggest man England could send,
a rale Lord beside. Rin honey, I must go to my
sisters."</p>

<p>The little girl walked rather slowly instead, much
perturbed in her mind. The Duvernay place joined
the Carrick place and at present they were mostly
ranged round the Fort. That was much smaller, but
better kept and there were even some late hardy
flowers in bloom.</p>

<p>"What's all the noise, Posy?" asked Grandfather
Duvernay. He was an old, old man, a bright little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
Frenchman with snowy white hair, but bright dark
eyes. He was a good deal wrinkled as became a
great-grandfather, and he sat in a high-backed chair
at one corner of the wide stone chimney that was all
built in the room. There was a fine log fire and
Grandmother Bradin was stirring a savory mass of
herbs. The real grandfather was out in the barn,
looking after the stock.</p>

<p>"It was Kirsty ringing two bells. Cornwallis is
taken."</p>

<p>"No!" The little man sprang up and clasped his
hands. "You are sure you heard straight! It wasn't
Washington?"</p>

<p>"I'm quite sure. And Nelly Mullin said 'run and
tell your mother, your father'll be coming home.'"</p>

<p>"Thank the good God." He dropped down in the
chair again and closed his eyes, bent his head reverently
and prayed.</p>

<p>"Your mother's asleep now. She's had a pretty
good night. Run out and tell gran."</p>

<p>Grandfather Bradin kissed his little girl, though
he was almost afraid to believe the good news. Three
years Bernard Carrick had been following the fortunes
of war and many a dark day had intervened.</p>

<p>"Oh, that won't end the war. There's Charleston
and New York. But Cornwallis! I must go out and
find where the news came from."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span></p>

<p>"Grandad don't believe it!" There was still a look
of doubt in her eyes.</p>

<p>Bradin laughed. "I d' know as he'd believe it if
he saw the articles of peace signed. He'll stick to
King George till he's laid in his coffin. There, I've
finished mending the steps and I'll slip on my coat and
go."</p>

<p>"I couldn't go with you?" wistfully.</p>

<p>"No, dear. I'll run all about and get the surest
news. I s'pose it came to the Fort, but maybe by the
South road."</p>

<p>He took the child's hand and they went into the
house. The streets were all astir. Grandfather stood
by the window looking out, but he turned and smiled
and suddenly broke out in his native French. His
face then had the prettiness of enthusiastic old age.</p>

<p>"We'll shake hands on it," said Bradin. "I'm going
out to see. There couldn't be a better word."</p>

<p>The autumnal air was chilly and he wrapped his
old friese cloak around him.</p>

<p>"Mother's awake now," said Mrs. Bradin. "You
may go in and see her."</p>

<p>The door was wide open now. It was as large as
the living room, but divided by a curtain swung
across, now pushed aside partly. There was a bed
in each corner. A light stand by the head of the
bed, a chest of drawers, a brass bound trunk and
two chairs completed the furnishing of this part. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
yellow walls gave it a sort of cheerful, almost sunshiny
look, and the curtain at the window with its
hand-made lace was snowy white. The painted floor
had a rug through the centre that had come from
some foreign loom. The bedstead had high slender
carved posts, but was without a canopy.</p>

<p>A woman still young and comely as to feature lay
there. She was thin, which made the eyes seem
larger and darker. The brown hair had a certain
duskiness and was a curly fringe about the forehead.
She smiled up at the little girl, who leaned over and
kissed her on the cheek.</p>

<p>"You are better, mother dear," she said as she
seated herself with a little spring on the side of the
bed. "But you said so yesterday. When will it be
real, so you can get up and go out?" and a touch of
perplexity crossed the child's face.</p>

<p>"Gra'mere thinks I may sit up a little while this
afternoon. I had no fever yesterday nor last night."</p>

<p>"Oh, mother, I was to tell you that Cornwallis has&mdash;it's
a long word that has slipped out of my mind.
Nelly Mullin said her husband would come home and
my father. Kirsty Boyle rang two bells&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, what was it? Go and ask grandfather,
child," and the mother half rose in her eagerness.</p>

<p>"It was 'sur-ren-dered' with his army. Father
has gone to see. And then the war will end."</p>

<p>"Oh, thank heaven, the good God, and all the saints,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
for I think they must have interceded. They must
be glad when dreadful wars come to an end."</p>

<p>She laid her head back on the pillow and the tears
fringed her dark lashes.</p>

<p>The child was thinking, puzzling over something.
Then she said suddenly, "What is my father like?
I seem to remember just a little&mdash;that he carried me
about in his arms and that we all cried a good
deal."</p>

<p>"It was three years and more ago. He loved us
very much. But he felt the country needed him.
And the good Allfather has kept him safe. He has
never been wounded or taken prisoner, and if he
comes back to us&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But what is surrendered?"</p>

<p>"Why, the British army has given up. And Lord
Cornwallis is a great man. England, I believe,
thought he could conquer the Colonies. Oh, Daffodil,
you are too little to understand;" in a sort of helpless
fashion.</p>

<p>"He isn't like grandad then. Grandad wants England
to beat."</p>

<p>"No, he isn't much like grandad. And yet dear
grandad has been very good to us. Of course he was
desperately angry that your father should go for a
soldier. Oh, if he comes home safe!"</p>

<p>"Dilly," said gran'mere, pausing at the door with a
piece of yellow pumpkin in her hand which she was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
peeling, "you must come away now. You have
talked enough to your mother and she must rest."</p>

<p>The child slipped down and kissed the pale cheek
again, then came out in the living-room and looked
around. The cat sat washing her face and at every
dab the paw went nearer her ear.</p>

<p>"You shan't, Judy! We don't want rain, do we,
grandfather?" She caught up the cat in her arms,
but not before pussy had washed over one ear.</p>

<p>Grandfather laughed. "Well, it <i>does</i> make it rain
when she washes over her ear," the little girl said with
a very positive air. "It did on Sunday."</p>

<p>"And I guess pussy washes over her ear every
day in the week."</p>

<p>"It's saved up then for the big storms;" with a
triumphant air.</p>

<p>"Get the board and let's have a game. You're so
smart I feel it in my bones that you will beat."</p>

<p>She put Judy down very gently, but the cat switched
her tail around and wondered why. She brought out
the board that was marked like "Tit tat toe," and a
box that she rattled laughingly. Pussy came when
they had adjusted it on their knees and put two
white paws on it, preparatory to a jump.</p>

<p>"Oh, Judy, I can't have you now. Come round
and sit by the fire."</p>

<p>Judy went round to the back of Dilly's chair and
washed over both ears in a very indignant manner.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span></p>

<p>The play was Fox and Geese. There was one red
grain of corn for the fox and all the geese were
white. One block at the side was left vacant. If
you could pen the fox in there without losing a goose
or at the most two or three, you were the winner.
But if once you let the fox out the geese had to fly for
their lives. Grandfather often let the little girl beat.</p>

<p>He was very fond of her, and he was a sweet-natured
old man who liked to bestow what pleasure
he could. Just now he was feeling impatient for the
news and wanted to pass away the time.</p>

<p>Dilly was quite shrewd, too, for a little girl not yet
seven. She considered now and moved a far off
goose, and the fox knew that was sour grapes.</p>

<p>"Oh, you're a sharp one!" exclaimed grandfather.
"I'll have to mind how I doze on this bout."</p>

<p>But alas! On the next move she let him in a little
way, then she fenced him out again, and lost one goose
repairing her defences. But it wasn't a bad move.
The great art was to keep one goose behind another
for protection. He couldn't jump over but one at a
time.</p>

<p>She beat grandfather, who pretended to be quite
put out about it and said she'd do for an army general.
Grandmother was making a pumpkin pudding
with milk and eggs and sugar and stick-cinnamon,
which was quite a luxury. Then she poured it into
an iron pan that stood upon little feet, drew out a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
bed of coal, and plumped it down. The cover had a
rim around the top, and she placed some coals on the
top of this. She baked her bread in it, too. Stoves
were great luxuries and costly. Then she laid some
potatoes in the hot ashes and hung a kettle of turnips
on the crane.</p>

<p>Grandfather and the little girl had another game
and she was the fox this time and lost, getting
penned up.</p>

<p>"Grandfather," she said sagely, "if you know the
good early moves and don't make any mistake, you're
sure to win."</p>

<p>"I believe that is so. You're getting a stock of
wisdom, Dilly. Oh, won't your father be surprised
when he comes home. You were a mere baby when
he went away."</p>

<p>She was an oddly pretty child. Her hair was really
yellow, soft and curly, then her eyes were of so dark
a blue that you often thought them black. The eyebrows
and lashes were dark, the nose rather piquant,
the mouth sweet and rosy, curved, with dimples in
the corners. But in those days no one thought much
about beauty in children.</p>

<p>The door was flung open.</p>

<p>"Ugh!" ejaculated Gran Bradin. "It's fairly
wintry. Fire feels good! The news is just glorious!
They headed off Cornwallis after having destroyed
their fortifications and dismantled their cannon. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
British works were so in ruins they tried escape. One
section of troops crossed over to Glous'ter Point, but a
storm set in and dispersed the boats. There was
nothing left but surrender. So the great army and
the great general who were to give us the finishing
stroke, handed in their capitulation to General Washington.
There are between seven and eight thousand
prisoners and all the shipping in the harbor. Grandfather,
you may be proud. We had, it is thought,
seven thousand French troops, with Count De Rochambeau,
and Count De Grasse."</p>

<p>He reached over and wrung grandfather's slim
white hand with its tracery of blue veins. Then he
kissed his wife. "They've been good friends to us.
We'll never forget that!"</p>

<p>"And the war is over?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly that. We've yet to dislodge them
from various places. But they think now England
will be willing to treat. And we'll have a country
of our own! Well, it was three weeks ago."</p>

<p>There were no telegraphs, and only the more important
places had post roads. Pittsburg was quite
out of the way. It had no dreams of grandeur in
those days, and about its only claim to eminence was
Braddock's defeat.</p>

<p>"Lang brought some copies of the Philadelphia
<i>Gazette</i>, but you couldn't get near one, they were
rushed off so. But we'll hear it all in a few days.

Too much good news might puff us up with vain
glory. We may look for letters any day. Such a
splendid victory!"</p>

<p>Grandfather was wiping the tears from his eyes.
Marc Bradin went in to comfort his daughter, though
he could hardly forbear smiling with a sense of inward
amusement as he thought of Sandy Carrick, who had
as good as disowned his son for joining the Colonial
army. He'd be glad enough to have him back again.
Though he had been rather disgruntled at his marrying
Barbe Bradin because she had French blood in
her veins, as if the Irish Bradin could not in some degree
counteract that!</p>

<p>Sandy Carrick had been in the sore battle of Braddock's
defeat. But after all the cowardly French
had thought retreat the better part of valor and left
the Fort that had been partly burned, left that section
as well, and the government had erected the new Fort
Pitt. He insisted that the French had been really
driven out. They certainly had been checked in their
advance to the Mississippi.</p>

<p>Pittsburg was a conglomerate in these early days.
Welsh, Irish, and English had contributed to its then
small population of the few hundreds whose history
and beginning were like so many other emigrants.
The houses were ranged largely about the Fort for
protection from the Indians. There were small
crooked lanes, a few dignified by-streets, Penn Street,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
Duquesne way, Water and Ferry streets. Colonel
George Morgan had built a double-hewn log house
of considerable dimensions, the first house in the settlement
to have a shingle roof. Though the "Manor
of Pittsburg" had been surveyed and Fort Pitt had
been abandoned by the British under orders of General
Gage and occupied by Virginia troops under Captain
John Neville.</p>

<p>There were some French residents, some Acadians
as well, and a few Virginians who were mostly
refugees. The houses were of very primitive construction,
generally built of logs, but made comfortable
on the inside. The emigrants had brought their industries
with them. The women spun and knit, there
were several rude looms, but they depended largely
on Philadelphia for supplies.</p>

<p>Pierre Duvernay had fled to Ireland in one of the
Huguenot persecutions, but more fortunate than
many, he had been able to take some of his worldly
possessions. Here his only daughter had married
Marc Bradin, his only son had died, and his wife had
followed. Broken-hearted he had accompanied his
daughter and son-in-law to the new Colonies. They
had spent a few years in Virginia, then with some
French friends had come to Pittsburg and bought a
large holding, which seemed at the time a misadventure,
and so they had built in nearer to the Fort. Here
pretty Barbe Bradin had grown up and married Bernard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
Carrick, their neighbor's son, but they had
not let the hospitable Bradin home. Here Daffodil
had been born, and the French and Irish blended
again.</p>

<p>"What made you call me Daffodil?" the child said
one day to her mother. "You were named after your
mother and gran'mere after hers, and you should have
called me Barbe."</p>

<p>"It would have made no end of confusion. You
see it does with great-grandfather. And when you
were born it was lovely sunshiny weather and the
daffodils were in bloom with their tender gold. Then
you had such a funny fuzzy yellow head. I loved
the Daffodils so. They come so early and look so
cheerful, and you were such a cheerful baby, always
ready to smile."</p>

<p>"Do you suppose my hair will always stay yellow?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no. It will grow darker."</p>

<p>"Like yours?"</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps not quite as dark. I like it. You
are my spring. If I were in any sorrow, your brightness
would comfort me."</p>

<p>Then the sorrow came. The young husband felt it
his duty to join the struggling army and fight for his
country. It was in doubtful times.</p>

<p>This queer, rural, primitive settlement knew little
about the great causes. Since the new fort had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
built and the French repulsed, absolutely driven out
of their strongholds, there had been only the infrequent
Indian encounters to rouse them. The stern
resolves, the mighty enthusiasm of the Eastern Colonies
had not inspired them. Even the Declaration of
Independence, while it had stirred up their alien and
contradictory blood, had not evoked the sturdy patriotism
of the larger towns having so much more at
stake. They added to their flocks and herds, they
hunted game and wild animals, and on the whole enjoyed
their rural life.</p>

<p>Sandy Carrick had never known which side to affiliate
with the most strongly. There was the brave
old Scottish strain that his mother had handed down
in many a romantic tale, there was the Irish of his
father that had come down almost from royalty itself,
from the famous Dukes that had once divided
Ireland between them. Why the Carricks had
espoused the English side he could not have told.
He was glad to come to the new countries. And
when, after being a widower for several years, he married
pretty buxom widow Boyle, he was well satisfied
with his place in life.</p>

<p>He had been in the fateful encounter at Braddock's
defeat at his first introduction to the country. The
French were well enough in Canada, which seemed
not very far from the North Pole, and a land of
eternal snow, but when they came farther down with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
their forts and their claims it was time to drive them
out, and nothing gave him greater satisfaction than
to think they were mostly out.</p>

<p>He took a great fancy to his next-door neighbor,
Marc Bradin, but he fought shy of the old black-eyed
Frenchman. Pierre Duvernay had passed through
too many vicissitudes and experiences to believe that
any one party had all the right; then, too, he was a
sweet-natured old man, thinking often of the time
when he should rejoin friends and relatives, not a few
of whom had died for their faith.</p>

<p>Sandy had not liked his son's marriage with Barbe
Bradin, who certainly was more French than Irish,
but she had a winsome brightness and vivacity, and
indulged in many a laughing tilt with her father-in-law.
Nora Boyle openly favored them all. They
spun and knit and made lace and wove rugs of rags
and compared cookery, and she and Mrs. Bradin were
wildly happy over Daffodil.</p>

<p>"If 't had been a boy now!" exclaimed Sandy.
"A gal's good for naught when it comes to handin'
down the name. Though if its hair'll turn out red,
an 't looks so now, it may flout t'other blood," putting
a strong expletive to it.</p>

<p>"Don't now, Sandy!" said his wife's coaxing voice.
"There's sorts and kinds in the world. The good
Lord didn't mean us all to be alike or he'd made 'em
so to start with."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span></p>

<p>"Did make 'em so, woman. There was only two
of 'em!"</p>

<p>"Well, some others came from somewhere. And
Cain went off an got himself a wife. An' when you
think of the baby there's good three parts Irish to
the one French. An' I'm sure no one keeps a tidier
house, an' the little old man sittin' by the chimney
corner hurts no one. And it's handy to have a neebur
to play at cards."</p>

<p>When there came an urgent call for men to join
what seemed almost a lost cause Bernard Carrick
went to Philadelphia with perhaps twenty other recruits,
to the sorrow of his wife and the anger of his
father.</p>

<p>"For they can't win, the blunderin' fules! D'y
spose King George's goin' to let a gran' country like
this slip out of his fingers. Barbery, if you were half
a woman you'd 'a' held onto him if y'd had to spit on
yer han's to do it. You'll never see him agen, an' it
comforts me for the loss of my son that you've lost
your husband. Ye can git anither one, but I'll have
no more sons to comfort me in my old age."</p>

<p>Poor Barbe was wild with grief, yet somehow
Bernard's sense of duty to his country <i>had</i> inspired
her, and then she had her little darling, her mother,
and father, and grandfather, who had not outlived a
certain heroic strain if his blood had come through
French channels.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span></p>

<p>The people of Pittsburg had no tea to throw overboard.
The Stamp Act bore lightly on them. They
could brew good beer, they could distil whiskey and
make passable wine. Fish and game were in abundance,
the fields laughed with riotous harvests, so what
if a few did go to war?</p>

<p>Sandy relented after a little and they took up the
evenings of card-playing, with the cider or beer and
doughnuts, or a brittle kind of spice cake that Mrs.
Bradin could make in perfection. They had arguments,
to be sure: Marc Bradin was on the side of the
Colonies, and he had taken pains to keep informed of
the causes of disaffection. It was going to be a big
country and could govern itself since it must know
better what was needed than a king thousands of miles
away!</p>

<p>Sandy held his spite against the French sufficiently
in abeyance to learn to play piquet with great-grandfather.
It interested him wonderfully, and since two
could play a game the women could knit and sew
and gossip. News came infrequently. Bradin often
went to the Fort to hear. If there were reverses, he
held his peace in a cheerful sort of way&mdash;if victories,
there was rejoicing among themselves. For they
tried not to ruffle Sandy Carrick unnecessarily.</p>

<p>Daffodil went often to see grandad and Norry, as
they called the merry-hearted second wife, who nearly
always had some tidbit for her. And grandad took
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
her on journeys sitting in front of him on an improvised
pillion, teaching her to sit astride and buckling
a strap around both bodies.</p>

<p>"For you'll have to be my boy, Dilly. My other
boy'll never come back to us."</p>

<p>"Where will he go?" in her wondering tone.</p>

<p>"The Lord only knows, child."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />
<br />
A JOYFUL RETURN</h2>

<p>"It is so good to get out among you all," Barbe
Carrick said, as she was pillowed up in a big high-backed
chair and wrapped in a soft gray blanket.
Her hair was gathered in a pretty white cap with a
ruffle of lace about the edge, framing in her rather
thin face. "So good! And the good news! Why,
I feel almost well."</p>

<p>It had been a slow autumnal fever, never very serious,
but wearing. Mrs. Bradin knew the use of
many herbs and was considered as good as a doctor
by most of the settlers.</p>

<p>The room would have made a fine "Interior," if
there had been a Dutch artist at hand. It was of
good dimensions, or the great fireplace would have
dwarfed it. Marc Bradin was a handy man, as not
a few were in those days when new settlers could not
encumber themselves with much furniture. There
were some of the old French belongings, a sort of
escritoire that had drawers below and shelves above
and was in two pieces. But the tables and chairs
and the corner cupboard were of his fashioning.
There was china, really beautiful pewter ware, some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
pieces of hammered brass, candlesticks, and one curious
lamp. The rafters were dark with age and smoke,
but they were not ornamented with flitches of bacon,
for there was a smoke-house out one side.</p>

<p>The chairs would pass for modern Mission furniture.
A few had rockers, notably that in which the
little girl sat, with Judy on her lap, and the cat almost
covered her. Grandfather was in his accustomed
place. There was a small table beside him on which
were his old French Bible, a book of devotion, and a
volume or two of poems, and a tall candlestick with
two branches. Gran'mere was doing some white embroidery,
a frock for the little girl's next summer's
wear. Mrs. Bradin had been settling her
daughter and now stood undecided as to her next
duty.</p>

<p>"Has father gone out again?" Barbe asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, to the Fort&mdash;to see if he can't get one of
the papers."</p>

<p>"It's wonderful news!" and the invalid drew a
long breath of delight. "But it isn't real peace yet."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, I do believe it is the beginning, though,"
said her mother.</p>

<p>"I wish the sun would shine. It ought to;" and
Barbe gave a wan half smile.</p>

<p>"But it isn't going to," announced Daffodil confidently.
"And it <i>is</i> going to rain."</p>

<p>Grandfather laughed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, Dilly?"</p>

<p>"Because." The child colored. "Oh, you will
see."</p>

<p>There was a tap at the door and then it opened.
Norah Carrick dropped the shawl she had thrown
over her head. A still pretty, heartsome-looking
woman, with a merry face bright with roses, laughing
blue eyes, and dark hair.</p>

<p>"It's good for sore eyes to see you up, Barbe. I
hope we'll have some fine weather to brace up one.
An'&mdash;an' 'twas good news you heard the morn." Then
she gave a funny, rippling laugh.</p>

<p>"But he'll be glad to have Bernard come back,"
Barbe exclaimed resentfully.</p>

<p>"Ah, that he will! Ye mustna mind him child, if
he's cranky for a bit. He's been that set about
England winning the game that you'd take him for
wan of the high dukes that sit in state and tell what
shall be done. I've been for the country all along.
It runs in my mind that Ireland owes the king a
gredge. She's been a cross-grained stepmother, say
your best. An' why couldn't she let us go on an'
prosper! We'd been willin' enough to work for her
part of the time. An' it's not such an easy thing to
lave your own bit of a home and come over here in
these wilds, an' hew down trees for your houses and
clear land for the corn, an' fight Indians. So I'm
wishin' the country to win. But Sandy's carryin' the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
black cat round on his back to-day, an' it makes me
laugh, too. He's that smart when he gets a little
riled up, and he's husked corn to-day as if he was
keepin' time with Nickey Nick's fiddle."</p>

<p>"What makes the black cat stay on his back?"
asked Daffodil, stroking her own pussy softly.</p>

<p>"Ah, that's just a say so, Dilly darlin', for a spell
of gettin' out of temper when there's no need. But
he made a good dinner. I had just the stew he liked,
an' a Donegal puddin' that come down from my great-grandmother.
An', Barbe, you begin to look like
crawlin' about again an' not so washed out. The
good news should make a warm streak all through
you."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm much better. If it will come off nice an'
warm&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We'll have a storm first. And is there any more
news?"</p>

<p>She had been taking some work out of a bag after
she had nodded to gran'mere and shaken hands with
great-grandfather. Now she settled herself and began
to sew. She was never idle. Sandy Carrick had
the smartest wife anywhere about and few women
would have minded his queer quips so little.</p>

<p>Then the door opened and Marc Bradin entered,
thrusting out a newspaper.</p>

<p>"I've been waiting my turn and have promised to
have it back in half an hour, but I'll not count the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
coming and going," laughing. "And it's news worth
waiting for. It's all true and more, too. And if we
want a King or an Emperor, General Washington's
the man. Now I'll read, since that's the cheapest
way, as you can all hear at once."</p>

<p>He dropped into a chair and threw his old cap on
the floor. Bradin was an excellent reader. Yes, it
was glorious news. A big battle averted and soldiers
disabled by honor rather than wounds. A vivid description
of what had led up to the surrender and the
conditions, the enthusiasm and the predictions that
at last victory was achieved for the Colonies. And
although numerous points were still held by the English,
it would be difficult to rouse enthusiasm after this
crushing blow.</p>

<p>"Time's up," said the reader. "But you have all
the real gist of the matter. Norah, how's Sandy?"</p>

<p>Norah gave a laugh and a shrug of the shoulders.</p>

<p>"Oh, he'll come round. I can't see, with all the
Scotch an' Irish in him, why he must be shoutin' for
King George just because he happened to fight on
that side years ago. An' it was under Washington,
too, an' people do say if Braddock hadn't been so
high an' mighty, and taken some of the young man's
counsel, there wouldna have been such an awful defeat."</p>

<p>"I'll come right back, jinky! It begins to rain."</p>

<p>Dilly looked up in triumph. "I told you so," she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
said, "and you just laughed, grandfather. Now you
see Judy knew."</p>

<p>She gave Judy an extra hug and squeezed a faint
mew out of her.</p>

<p>"Judy is a wise cat," admitted grandfather.</p>

<p>"And I must run home an' get a supper that'll be a
soothin' poultice to the inside of the man," laughed
Norah. "I'm glad I know about how things stand,
so my heart will be light. An' we will have Bernard
home safe and sound, never you fear, so, Barbe, get
well to welcome him. I'm cooking chicken to-morrow
an' I'll send over broth an' a bit of the breast. Run
over to-morrow, little one. Grandad'll be all right."</p>

<p>Barbe was tired and went to bed. Dilly moved
over by grandfather and begged for a story. He
and Norah had a packful of them. It grew darker
and rained, with a sort of rushing wind.</p>

<p>When Dilly grew older and began to understand
what real living was, it seemed as if this was her
actual induction into it. She had run about and
played, listened to stories and songs, gravitated between
the two houses, ridden with grandad, who was
always a little jealous that most of her relatives should
be on the French side. She could shut her eyes and
hear Kirsty's raucous voice and the two bells he was
ringing and see grandad's upturned nose and his derisive
tone. She awoke to the fact that she really had
a father.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span></p>

<p>Grandad used to come over in the evening and play
piquet with old grandfather. It was a game two
could enjoy, and the women folk were no great hands
at card-playing. Now and then, when Norah was not
too busy, they had a friendly, social game. It rained
two days and then cleared up in the glory of perfect
autumn weather. Nothing came to counteract the
good tidings. Grandad came for Daffodil to take a
ride with him, and that evening he sauntered in and
had a game of piquet and beat. It always delighted
him. It was fighting the French over again.</p>

<p>Barbe improved rapidly now. People were quite
apt to have what was called a run of fever in the
autumn at the change of the seasons, and there were
some excellent home-brewed remedies and tonics that
answered, if the case was not too severe.</p>

<p>Dilly and her mother talked a great deal about the
return of the husband and father.</p>

<p>"Is he like grandad?" she inquired with a little
contraction of the brows.</p>

<p>"Oh, not much. He was called a handsome young
fellow. Your eyes are like his, and he had such a
brilliant color then," sighing a little and wondering
if the hardships had made him old before his time.</p>

<p>"And&mdash;and his nose?" hesitatingly.</p>

<p>Barbe laughed. "It isn't short like grandad's. His
mother was a handsome woman."</p>

<p>"It's queer," said the child reflectively, "that you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
can have so many grand relatives and only one father.
And only one gran'mere. For Norry isn't <i>real</i>, is she,
since she isn't father's mother. And how many wives
can one have?"</p>

<p>"Only one at a time. It's quite a puzzle to little
folks. It was to me."</p>

<p>Daffodil looked at her mother with wondering eyes
and said thoughtfully, "Were you truly little like me?
And did you like grandad? Did he take you out on
his big horse?"</p>

<p>"We were living in Virginia then. Great-grandfather
and great-grandmother were living there&mdash;she
was alive then. And when she died gran'mere and
gran came out here. I was about eight. And we
didn't like it here. The children were so different."</p>

<p>"It is all very queer," said Dilly. "You are little,
and then you grow, and&mdash;and you get married. Will
I be married? Must you find some one&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Dilly, I think some one will find you;" and
her mother laughed. "You will have to grow up and
be&mdash;well, eighteen, I think, almost a dozen years before
you need to think about it."</p>

<p>"I'm very glad," she said soberly.</p>

<p>She did not like things that puzzled her. The war
was another. What had it been about? Grandad
was sure the English were right, and great-grandfather
was glad they were going to be beaten.</p>

<p>She used to dream of her father, and watch out for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
him. For some of the companies were furloughed,
his among them. And now he was Captain Carrick.</p>

<p>Christmas came. There was not much made of it
here, as there had been in Virginia, no gift-giving, but
family dinners that often ended in a regular carouse,
sometimes a fight. For Pittsburg had not reached
any high point of refinement, and was such a conglomerate
that they could hardly be expected to agree
on all points.</p>

<p>The little girl lost interest presently in watching
for her father, and half believed he was not coming.
She was very fond of grandad, and Norry, and the
wonderful stories she heard about fairies and "little
folk," who came to your house at night, and did wonderful
things&mdash;sometimes spun the whole night long,
and at others did bits of mischief. This was when
you had offended them some way.</p>

<p>She liked the Leprecawn so much. He was a
fairy shoemaker, and when all was still in the night
you sometimes heard him. "Tip tap, rip rap, Tick a
tack too!" And the little Eily, who wished so for
red shoes, but her folks were too poor to buy them.
So she was to find six four-leaf clovers, and lay them
on the doorstep, which she did.</p>

<p>"What a queer noise there was in the night," said
the mother. "It was like this, 'Tip tap, rip rap,'"</p>

<p>"Sho!" said the father, "it was the swallows in the
chimney."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span></p>

<p>Eily held her peace, but she put four-leafed clovers
again on the doorstep, and tried to keep awake, so she
could hear the little shoemaker.</p>

<p>"I'll clear them swallows out of the chimney, they
disturb me so," declared the father, and he got a long
pole and scraped down several nests. But the next
night the sound came again, and the mother began
to feel afeared. But when Eily went downstairs
there was a pair of little red shoes standing in the
corner, and Eily caught them up and kissed them, she
was so full of joy. Then her mother said, "The
Leprecawn has been here. And, Eily, you must never
wear them out of doors at the full of the moon, or
you'll be carried off."</p>

<p>"Was she ever, do you think, Norry?"</p>

<p>"Oh, her mother'd be very careful. For if you go
to fairyland, you'll have to stay seven years."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't like that," subjoined Dilly. "But I
<i>would</i> like the red shoes. And if I could find some
four-leaf clovers&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You can't in winter."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;next summer."</p>

<p>"Maybe grandad can find you some red leather,
and lame Pete can make them."</p>

<p>"But I rather have the fairy shoemaker, with his
'tip tap, rip rap';" laughing.</p>

<p>"Don't minch about him. Here's a nice chunk of
cake."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span></p>

<p>Dilly had cake enough to spoil a modern child's
digestion. But no one understood hygiene in those
days, and kept well.</p>

<p>There were no schools for little girls to go to.
But a queer old fellow, who lived by himself,
taught the boys, and tried to thrash some knowledge
in their brains. It was considered the best
method.</p>

<p>Dilly's mother taught her to read English, and
great-grandfather inducted her into French. Gran'mere
talked French to the old man. Every morning
she brushed his hair and tied it in a queue with a
black ribbon. He wore a ruffled shirt front, and lace
ruffles at his wrist; knee breeches, silk stockings, and
low shoes with great buckles.</p>

<p>Dilly learned to sew a little as well. But early industry
was not held in as high esteem as in the Eastern
Colonies. There was plenty of spinning and
knitting. Fashions did not change much in the way
of dress, so you could go on with your clothes until
they were worn out. The nicest goods were imported,
but there was a kind of flannelly cloth for winter wear,
that was dyed various colors, mostly blue and copperas,
which made a kind of yellow.</p>

<p>So the winter went on, and in February there came
a great thaw. Oh, how the river swelled, and rushed
on to the Ohio. It was very warm. And one day
Daffodil sat on the great stone doorstep, holding the

cat, and munching a piece of cake. Judy ate a few
crumbs, but she did not care much for it.</p>

<p>"There's a peddler," said Dilly to Judy. "He
has a big pack on his back, and he walks with a cane,
as if he was tired. And there's something hanging
to his waist, and a queer cap. He seems looking&mdash;why,
he's coming here. Gran'mere wants some
thread, but he isn't our&mdash;&mdash;Mother," she called.</p>

<p>He was thin, and pale, and travel-stained, and had
not the brisk, jaunty air of the peddlar.</p>

<p>But he came up the little path, and looked at her so
sharply she jumped up, hugging Judy tightly. "Some
one, mother," she said, half frightened.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carrick stepped to the door, and glanced.
Then, with a cry, she went to her husband's arms.</p>

<p>They both almost fell on the doorstep.</p>

<p>"Oh," she cried, "you are tired to death!
And&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind; I'm home. And I have all my limbs,
and have never been ill. It has been a desperate
struggle, but it's ending grandly. And everybody&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They are all alive and well. Oh, we've been
watching, and hoping&mdash;it doesn't matter now, you are
here;" and she leaned down on his shoulder and
cried.</p>

<p>"Three years and four months. I couldn't get
word very well, and thought I'd rather come on. You
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
see, my horse gave out, and I've had a ten-mile walk.
And&mdash;the baby?"</p>

<p>"Oh, she's a big girl. She was sitting here&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not that child!" in surprise.</p>

<p>"Daffodil," called her mother.</p>

<p>The child came shyly, hesitatingly.</p>

<p>"Dilly, it's father. We've talked of him so much,
you know. And you have watched out for him many
a time."</p>

<p>Somehow he didn't seem the father of her imagination.
He took her in his arms, and dragged her over
in his lap.</p>

<p>"Oh, I forgot you could grow," in a tone broken
with emotion. "But her blue eyes, and her yellow
hair. Oh, my little darling! We shall have to get
acquainted over again;" and he kissed the reluctant
lips. "Oh, it is all like a dream! Many and many
a time I thought I should never see you again;" and
he wiped the tears from his eyes.</p>

<p>"If you are glad, what makes you cry?" asked the
child, in a curious sort of way.</p>

<p>Barbe put her arms around Dilly. Of course, no
child could understand.</p>

<p>"And the others," began Bernard Carrick.</p>

<p>"Oh, let us go in." There was a tremble of joy in
her voice. "Mother, grandfather, he has come!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Bradin greeted her son-in-law with fond affection,
and a great thanksgiving that he had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
spared to return to them. They talked and cried,
and Daffodil looked on wonderingly. Great-grandfather
Duvernay, who had been taking his afternoon
rest, came out of his room, and laid his hand
tremblingly in the younger one, that had not lost its
strength. Yes, he was here again, in the old home,
amid them all, after many hardships.</p>

<p>"Oh, sit down," said Mother Bradin. "You look
fit to drop. And you must have something to eat,
and a cup of tea. Or, will it be a man's tipple?
There's some good home-brewed beer&mdash;or a sup of
whiskey."</p>

<p>"I'll take the tea. It's long since I've had any.
And if I could wash some of the dust off&mdash;it must be
an inch thick."</p>

<p>Ah, that was something like the old smile, only
there was a hollow in the cheek, that used to be so
round and so pink. She took him into her room, and,
filling a basin with warm water, set it on the cedar
chest, spreading a cloth over it, that he might splash
in comfort.</p>

<p>"It's been a long journey," he said. "But the poor
horse gave out first. Boyle, and Truart, and Lowy
were with me, but not to come quite so far. Some
of the young fellows remained, though the feeling is
that there won't be much more fighting. The impression
is that England's about as tired of the war
as we."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span></p>

<p>"But you wouldn't have to go back again?" Barbe
protested, in a sort of terror.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;no;" yet the tone was not altogether reassuring.</p>

<p>She took his coat out by the door and brushed it,
but it was very shabby. Still, he looked much improved
when he re-entered the room, where Mrs.
Bradin had set a tempting lunch at the corner of the
table. But he could hardly eat for talking. Barbe
sat beside him&mdash;she could scarce believe he was there
in the flesh.</p>

<p>Daffodil went out in the sunshine again. She
started to run over to grandad's. Norry would be
so glad. Well, grandad too, she supposed. Had he
really believed father would never come home?
Somehow, it was different. In Norry's stories the
soldiers were strong, and handsome, and glittering
with gold lace, and full of laughter. She couldn't recall
whether they had any little girls or not. And
there was her mother hanging over the strange man&mdash;yes,
he <i>was</i> strange to her. And her mother would
care for him, and stay beside him, and she somehow
would be left out. Her little heart swelled. She did
not understand about jealousy, she had had all the
attention, and it was not pleasant to be pushed one
side. Oh, how long he was eating, and drinking, and
talking, and&mdash;yes, they laughed. Grandad was coming
up to the house with a great two-handled basket&mdash;she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
knew it was full of ears of corn, and she did so
like to see him shell it, and hear the rattle as it fell
down in the tub. He sat on a board across the tub,
and had a queer sort of affair, made by two blades, and
as he drew the ears of corn through it, scraped off
both sides.</p>

<p>No, she wouldn't even go and see grandad, for
he would say, "Well, yellow-top, your father hasna
come home yet;" and, she&mdash;well, she could not tell
a wrong story, and she would not tell the true one.
Grandad wouldn't go back on her, but he could
wait.</p>

<p>"Oh, Dilly, here you are!" said her mother, coming
out of the door, with her husband's arm around
her. "We're going over to grandad's; come;" and
she held out her hand.</p>

<p>The soldier looked more attractive. His faded cap
had been thrown aside, and his short dark hair was a
mass of curls. He looked sharply at the little girl,
and she turned away her face. Still, she took her
mother's hand.</p>

<p>Norry had been sitting by the window. Now she
rushed out with a shriek of joy.</p>

<p>"Oh, Barney! Barney! Sure, I've been afraid we'd
never set eyes on you again! The saints be praised!
Sandy!"</p>

<p>Sandy Carrick came and put his arms around his
son. Both were rather tall men. For some moments
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
neither spoke. Then the father said, "Cross the
threshold, Barney. An' here's a silver shilling&mdash;kiss
it for good luck an' a long stay."</p>

<p>Bernard did as his father bade him, and the two
crossed the threshold together.</p>

<p>"Now, you must have something to eat and drink,"
began hospitable Norah. "Deed an' true, the crows
would hardly make a meal of you."</p>

<p>"But I've been stuffed already," he protested.</p>

<p>"No matter. There's always room intil you're laid
on your back for the last time. An' you're that thin,
't would take two of you to make a shadow."</p>

<p>She set out cold chicken, and boiled bacon, and
bread that would tempt one on a fast day, with a great
loaf of cake, and Bernard and Barbe sat down. Sandy
brought out the whiskey bottle. No one thought of
objecting in those days.</p>

<p>"Oh, where's the colleen?" and Norah stepped
to the door.</p>

<p>"Has she gone back home? She takes it a little
strange," said Barbe. "She can't remember well.
But she'll come to it presently." Then Barbe raised
her eyes and met her husband's, that were so full of
adoration; she blushed like a girl.</p>

<p>"And the war is over," declared Norah. "Did
they all have leave to go home?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no. We can't say it's over, though the
thought is there'll be no more hard fighting. And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
we've some good friends on the other side to argue
the case for us."</p>

<p>"No, no," snorted Sandy. "It's not over by a long
shot. An' then they'll get to fightin' atween theirselves,
and split here an' there. Weel, Mr. Captain,
are we to have a King or a great Emperor, like him
of France, with a court an' all that?"</p>

<p>Bernard laughed. "We'll have neither. We've
gotten rid of kings for all time."</p>

<p>"Don't do your skreeking until you're well out o'
the woods. But I hope you'll be wise enough next
time to let t'other fellow take his chance. An' it beats
me to think a great Lord an' a great soldier, too,
should be put about, and captured by a crowd of ignoramuses
without training."</p>

<p>"Oh, you learn a good deal in five or six years,"
said the son good-naturedly. "There have been the
Indians and the French."</p>

<p>"And I can't abide turn-coats. First we fight for
th' old country, then turn around and fight forninst
it. We lick the French, an' then ask their aid. A
fine country we'll have, when no one knows his own
mind!"</p>

<p>"You'll see the sort of country we'll make when we
get about it. And we have no end of brave fine men
who'll plan it out for us. Here's to your health and
luck. And now tell me what Pittsburg has been
doing."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span></p>

<p>He raised his glass and barely touched it to his lips.
Sandy drained his.</p>

<p>"There's not much doin'&mdash;how could there be, with
no money?" he answered shortly.</p>

<p>"But you've the place for a fine town. New York
and Philadelphia may have the start, but it's up to us
to come out fair in the race. You have the key to
the great West. Some day we'll clear the French
out of that."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't talk war," interposed Norah. "Tell
us if you're glad to get home. And should you have
known Dilly? She'll be the one to set hearts aching
with those eyes of hers, when she gets a bit grown
up."</p>

<p>"We must go back," said Barbe. "And, Bernard,
you must be stiff with your long tramp. They rode
mostly all night, and when the horses gave out,
walked. You must go to bed with the chickens."</p>

<p>Sandy gave a snort.</p>

<p>"I'll be over in the morn, ready for a talk or a
fight," laughed Bernard. "God be praised that He
has cared for us all these years, and let us meet
again."</p>

<p>Sandy looked after his son, who had the fine air of
a trained soldier.</p>

<p>"An' when we get him fatted up," said Norah, "he
will be main good-looking."</p>

<p>Daffodil had sauntered slowly homeward. She
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
looked for some one to call after her, but there was
no sound. Oh, her mother did not care for her now,
and Norry had not so much as coaxed her in and offered
her a piece of cake. She entered the house
rather sadly. Gran'mere was concocting some treat
for supper. She just turned and said, "Were they
glad to see your father?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I didn't go in." Then she crept
up alongside of grandfather, and leaned her face down
on his breast and cried softly.</p>

<p>"Dear, what has hurt my little girl?" pushing
aside the mop of hair.</p>

<p>"Mother won't want me any more. Nor grandad,
nor Norry, nor&mdash;nor any one;" and Daffodil seemed
very lonesome in a great cold world, colder than any
winter day.</p>

<p>"Yes, I want you. Oh, they'll all want you after
a day or two. And it's a great thing for your father
to come home safe."</p>

<p>"I don't believe I am going to like him. He isn't
like what I thought."</p>

<p>Grandfather smiled. "Wait and see what he is like
to-morrow. It's almost night now, and things look
different, cloudy-like. There, dear, don't cry when
we are all full of joy."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />
<br />
WELCOME</h2>

<p>Neighbors kept dropping in, and the table was
crowded at supper time. Hospitality was ungrudging
in those days. Grandfather had the little girl
close under his wing, but she had a curiously strange
feeling, as if she was outside of it all. Then her
mother said:</p>

<p>"Wouldn't you rather go to bed, dear? The men
will want to talk about battles, and things, not best for
little girls to hear. When you are older they will interest
you more."</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied, and kissed grandfather. Then
her mother undressed her and tucked her in her little
pallet.</p>

<p>"Oh, you <i>will</i> always love me?" she cried, in a
tremulous tone.</p>

<p>"Always, always. And father, too." Even if
other children should come, the years when Daffodil
had been her all could never be dimmed.</p>

<p>The mother shut the door softly. They were kindly
enough, this conglomerate population, but rough, and
the French strain in the Bradins had tended to refinement,
as well as living somewhat to themselves.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span></p>

<p>Daffodil cried a little, it seemed a comfort. But
she was tired and soon fell asleep, never hearing a
sound, and the company was rather noisy. When she
woke, the door to the living room was partly open,
and the yellow candlelight was shining through.
Mornings were dark, for they had come to the shortest
days. There was a curious rustling sound, and
Dilly ran out in her little bare feet, though the carpet
was thick and warm. Gran'mere was cooking, Barbe
was washing dishes, Judy sat by the fire in a grave upright
fashion. How white the windows were!</p>

<p>"Oh, it's snow!" cried the little girl. "Are we
snowed up, as grandad tells about? Why, we can't
see out!"</p>

<p>"Yes, it's a tremendous snow. Bring out your
clothes, and let me dress you. Don't be noisy."</p>

<p>The child seldom was noisy. She wondered at
the request. And what had happened? She had
a confused sense of something unusual in her
mind.</p>

<p>"Father is asleep. It was late when he went to
bed last night, and he is so tired out that we shall
let him sleep as long as he will. Get your clothes,
and shut the door softly."</p>

<p>She did as she was bidden, with a furtive glance at
the mound under the blankets. Her mother soon had
her dressed in a sort of brownish red flannel frock,
and a blue and white checked apron. Then she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
brushed out her silky hair, and made three or four
thick curls.</p>

<p>"Oh, isn't it funny! Why, we can't see anything,
not a house, or a tree, nor grandad's."</p>

<p>They could see that in almost any storm.</p>

<p>She went and patted Judy. Gran'mere was frying
bacon, and when that was brown and crisp, she slipped
some eggs in the pan. Grandfather kept his bed late
winter mornings, and only wanted a bit of toast and a
cup of coffee. That was generally made by roasting
wheat grains, with a tiny bit of corn, and made very
fair coffee. But it was necessity then, not any question
of nerves or health.</p>

<p>So they ate their breakfast and everything seemed
quite as usual except the snow. So far there had
been none to speak of. Gran'mere put out the
candle, and the room was in a sort of whitey-gray
light.</p>

<p>There was queer, muffled banging outside, that came
nearer, and finally touched the door, and a voice said
"Hello! hello!"</p>

<p>Barbe opened it. There was grandad, in his frieze
coat and fur cap, a veritable Santa Claus.</p>

<p>"Well, was there ever the beat of this! Stars out
at twelve? The old woman's geese are gettin' plucked
close to the skin. Why, it's furious! Dilly, come out
and let me tumble you in the snow bank."</p>

<p>She shrank back, laughing.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span></p>

<p>"I'd have to dig you out again. How is the lad?
Did we upset grandfather with the racket?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no. He always sleeps late. Have a cup of
hot coffee."</p>

<p>"An' that's just what I will. Well, the lad's lucky
that he was no' a day later, he'd been stumped for
good. By the nose of St. Andrew, I never saw so
much snow fall in a little time. An' it's dark as the
chimney back."</p>

<p>"The snow is white," interposed Daffodil.</p>

<p>"Ah, ye're a cunnin' bairn. But put a lot of it together,
and it turns the air. The coffee's fine, it
warm the cockles of one's heart."</p>

<p>"What are they?"</p>

<p>"Oh, the little fellys that get hot, an' cold, an' keep
the blood racin' round. And have delight bottled up
to give out now and then when one is well treated."</p>

<p>Daffodil nodded. She was not going to say she did
not understand.</p>

<p>"An' the b'y? He wants fat, sure. The country's
made a poor shoat out of him. Well, I must go back,
shovelin' for the path's about grown up. The boss
out to the barn?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll kem over agin, an' give him a hand."</p>

<p>"Grandad has a good heart," said Mrs. Bradin.</p>

<p>Mr. Bradin came in presently with a pail of milk.
"This beats all for a storm," he said. "Now, I'll
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
take a second breakfast. Dilly, come and sit here beside
me, and take a taste of things. Not a livin' hen
is up yet, just balls of feathers on the perch."</p>

<p>"Couldn't you take me out to see them?"</p>

<p>"If you get snowed under, we'll have to send for
grandad. Well, they did have a roarin' time last
night. He was plucky to take that long walk, though
the poor fellows have had many a wearisome march."</p>

<p>He wrapped Dilly in a blanket, and carried her out
to the barn. There was Mooley munchin' her hay,
there was the pen of sheep that was always safe-guarded
at night, and the hens, funny balls of feathers,
sure enough. But the head of the flock stretched
up his long neck and crowed. The pigs grunted and
squealed a request for breakfast. Mr. Bradin threw
them a lot of corn.</p>

<p>"Oh, let me walk back," she exclaimed. But the
snow drifted in her eyes, and she tumbled over in
the snow bank. He picked her up, and they both
laughed.</p>

<p>Grandfather was up now, looking as neat and trim
as possible. He always read a chapter in his French
Bible, and Daffodil sat on the broad arm of the chair
and liked to listen. Then he had his breakfast on
the little stand, and Dilly ate the crust of his toast.
She liked so to crunch it in her teeth. Then she always
wanted a story about France, that seemed heroic
to her, though she hardly knew the meaning of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
word. But Norah's stories were generally amusing, and
grandfather did not believe in the "little people."</p>

<p>It was noon when the soldier made his appearance.
He really looked much refreshed, though his clothes
were worn and shabby. And he kissed his little girl
very fondly. Why, his blue eyes were very much
like hers, and his smile won one to smile in return.</p>

<p>And then the sun suddenly broke through the gray
clouds, and a gust of wind began tearing them to
tatters, and letting the blue through. Gran'mere
opened the door, and the very air was warm. She
drew long, reviving breaths. Grandad was coming
over again, with a great dish of roasted apples Norah
had sent.</p>

<p>"I should be ungrateful if I didn't get fat by the
minute," Bernard Carrick said. "But such a snow!"</p>

<p>"I never saw so much business done in the same
time, but it'll run off like a river. And the sun is
fairly hot. But there's plenty of time for winter yet.
How does it seem to be out of barracks, or tents, or
whatever you had, or didn't have?"</p>

<p>"There was a good deal of <i>not</i> having. But no
one hardly knows all the hardships, and the danger.
The wonder to me is that so many come out of it
alive. And home is a better thing for all a man has
passed through. I'm anxious to see how the town has
gone on."</p>

<p>"H-u-g," with a sort of disdain. "It hasn't gone
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
on. How could it, with the likeliest men thrashin'
round the country worse than wild Indians. For we
counted on their having a little more sense."</p>

<p>Bernard laughed. His father had been very angry
about his going, and it was funny to see him try to
be a little ungracious over his return, as he had been
so sure he would never come back alive.</p>

<p>"Suppose we go out and take a look at it?"</p>

<p>"In all the snow!" so amazed he reverted to the
ancient tongue. With the variety of people, and the
admixture of English, the rugged points of dialect
were being rubbed off.</p>

<p>"I've seen some snow, and travelled through it.
But this is rather queer. Such a glorious air, and
fairly a May day sun.</p>

<p>"Who dances barefoot in Janiveer will greet in
March."</p>

<p>"But they wouldn't go barefooted in the snow," exclaimed
Daffodil, in surprise.</p>

<p>"They wouldn't do it for choice, though I've seen
them dance with their feet tied up in rags. Dance
to keep themselves warm," said her father.</p>

<p>"Yes. Let us go to the Fort. You'll be wanting
to see the b'y's grown up now. An' the old folk."</p>

<p>"You haven't grown much older;" looking his
father over affectionately.</p>

<p>"Bedad! It's not much beyant three years, and
does a man get bowed over, an' knock-kneed, an' half-blind,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
an' bald-headed, an' walk with a stick in that
little time. Havers! Did you expect to see me bed-ridden!"</p>

<p>Bernard laughed. The same old contrarity that
was not so much temper after all.</p>

<p>"I can't say the same of you, more's the pity.
You've given the country, a pack of men who'll
never give you a thankee, your good looks, an' your
flesh, an' at least ten years. Ye're a middle-aged man,
Bernard Carrick!"</p>

<p>Bernard laughed again. It was like old times, and,
oh, how glad he was to be home again.</p>

<p>"Come, then; and, Dilly, run down an' see Norah,
an' have a good time."</p>

<p>Sandy took his son's arm, and they went off together.
Daffodil looked after them with long breaths
that almost brought tears to her eyes. Grandad hadn't
been glad when the news came; she could see just
how he had turned with his nose in the air, and now
he was claiming his son as if he had all the right.</p>

<p>Gran'mere was concocting some mystery on the
kitchen table, Barbe sat at the little wheel, spinning.
And she was singing, too. A faint pink had come
back to her cheek, and her eyes almost laughed with
delight.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"What's a' the steer, kimmer.</p>
<p>What's a' the steer,</p>
<p>Jamie has landed, and soon he will be here."</p>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span></p>

<p>She had a soft sweet voice. How long since she
had sung with that gayety. True, she had been ill,
and now she was well again, and Jamie had come
home. But grandad had taken him off, and that
somehow rankled in the child's heart.</p>

<p>She stood by the window, uncertainly. There were
only two small windows in the large room that
were of glass, for glass was costly. Another much
larger had board shutters, closed tightly, and a blanket
hung over it to keep out the cold. They called it the
summer window. One looked over to the other house
and Daffodil was there.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't go over if I were you," said her
mother. "It is very wet. Grandad might have carried
you, but he hardly knows whether he's on his
head or his heels."</p>

<p>"He'd look very funny on his head. What makes
him so glad? He was angry about&mdash;if that great general
hadn't&mdash;I can't say the long word, father couldn't
have come home."</p>

<p>She turned a very puzzled face to her mother.</p>

<p>"There might have been a big battle;" and the
mother shuddered. "Oh, grandad will be as glad
as the rest of us presently that we have a country.
Now we can begin to live."</p>

<p>It was all very strange to her small mind. The sun
was making rivulets through the snow, and the great
white unbroken sheets sparkled with iridescent lights.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
Out beyond there was the Fort; she could see figures
moving to and fro. Everything seemed so strange
to her. And a country of one's own! Would the
farms be larger, and, if England was beaten, what
would become of it? Would they, our people, go
over and take what they wanted? Would they drive
the people away as they did the Indians?</p>

<p>She was tired of so much thinking. She went over
to grandfather, and seated herself on the arm of the
chair. She did not want Norry's fairy stories. Leaning
her head down on the dear old shoulder, she said,
"Tell me about a great King, who beat the English."</p>

<p>"Are you going mad about the English?" her
mother asked laughingly. "We shall all be friends
again. Quarrels are made up. And so many of
us came from England."</p>

<p>"We didn't," returned Dilly decisively.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;on the one side Scotch and Irish."</p>

<p>"And on the other French, pure French, until your
mother married a Bradin, and you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And Marc Bradin has been a good husband to
me," said his wife, looking up from her preparations.</p>

<p>Truly, he had, and a kind son to him as well,
though he had not been in favor of the marriage at
first.</p>

<p>The story was about the grand old times in France.
He never told of the religious persecutions to the little
girl. He had a soft winsome sort of voice, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
often lapsed into French idioms, but she was always
charmed with it, even if she could not understand
all he said. Presently she went fast asleep.</p>

<p>Then the darkness began to fall. The candles were
lighted, and that roused both sleepers. There was a
savory smell of supper, even Judy went around sniffing.</p>

<p>"We won't wait any longer," gran'mere said, with
a little impatience. She had been cooking some messes
that she remembered her son-in-law was very fond
of, and she was disappointed that he was not here
to enjoy it.</p>

<p>After that grandfather went to bed. Dilly was wide
awake and held her cat, telling her a wonderful tale
of a beautiful woman who had been turned into a
cat by an ugly witch, and all the adventures she
could remember. Judy purred very loudly now and
then.</p>

<p>"Don't you want to go to bed?" asked Mrs. Carrick.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm not a bit sleepy." Then, after a pause,
"Will father stay at grandad's?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no. He is with the men at the Fort."</p>

<p>"But grandad took him away."</p>

<p>"Oh, they all want to see him."</p>

<p>"Doesn't he belong to us?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear. But they always make a time when
one comes home from the war."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span></p>

<p>"What queer things there are in the flames," the
child went on. "I think they fight, too. Look at
that long blue streak. Just as soon as the little red
ones come out, he swallows them up. Then he sits
and waits for some more, just as Judy does for a
mouse. It's funny!"</p>

<p>"There, I've spun out all my flax. Now let us both
come to bed."</p>

<p>There was a sound of voices outside. Then the
door was flung open, and Bernard Carrick entered,
with a rather noisy greeting, catching his wife in
his arms, and kissing her vehemently. Then he
clasped his arms about Dilly, and threw her up, she
was so small and light. She stretched out her hands
to her mother.</p>

<p>"Don't, Bernard; you frighten the child. We have
been waiting for you to come home. And now Dilly
must go to bed."</p>

<p>She took her little girl by the hand. Bernard
dropped in the big chair.</p>

<p>Barbe seldom undressed her now, but she did this
night. Presently Daffodil said in an imperious tone,
"Do you like my father? I don't. I like grandfather,
and gran, and grandad sometimes, but not
always. And&mdash;father&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush, dear. You will come to like him very
much, I know, for I love him dearly. Now, say your
little prayer and go to bed."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span></p>

<p>Barbe went out, poked the fire a little, put on another
log, and then sat down by her husband, who
had fallen into a heavy sleep. Had he given the
country something more than his service these three
years&mdash;his manhood, the tender and upright qualities
that dominated him when he went away? Sandy Carrick
was of the old school, strong and stalwart, and
not easily overcome, although he could not be called
dissipated in any sense. But Bernard had never been
of the roystering kind. She prayed from the depths
of her heart that he might be made aware of the
danger. The fire dropped down again, and she roused
with a sudden shiver, rising and looking intently at
him. The flush was gone, he was pale and thin
again. Then he opened his eyes and saw her standing
there. After a moment he held out both hands,
and clasped hers.</p>

<p>"Forgive me, Barbe," he said. "I ought not have
come home to you like that, but they are a wild lot
and I hadn't the strength to stand it after the months
of privations. Zounds! what a head my father has!
I haven't been indulging in such junkets. I wanted to
come home alive to you and the little one. But I
couldn't get away without offence and one goes farther
than one can bear. Don't think I brought the
detestable habit home with me, though many a poor
fellow does yield to it and you can't blame them so
much, either."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span></p>

<p>"No," she answered softly, and kissed him on the
forehead, much relieved at his frankness. Then as
an afterthought&mdash;"I hope you didn't quarrel with
anybody."</p>

<p>"Oh, no. Party spirit runs high. A man who has
never seen anything beyond an Indian skirmish thinks
he could set the country on its feet by any wild
plan. And here we have so many shades of opinion.
Father's amuse me; I wonder how he and great-grandfather
keep such amicable friends!"</p>

<p>"Oh, he has no one nearby to play a game of piquet
with him. And the Duvernay temper is much milder.
But you must be tired. Let us fix the fire for the
night."</p>

<p>"Tell me when I have it right. I am not quite sure,
though I have looked after many a camp fire. And
now I am here to ease you up somewhat, and look out
for you. Your father has been very good through
these troublous times, and I will see that he need not
be ashamed of his son."</p>

<p>"Oh," she cried with deep emotion, "you make
me very happy. So much of our lives are yet to
come."</p>

<p>There followed several pleasant days. The snow
ran off and another came and vanished.</p>

<p>There was little doing. Some people had looms in
their houses and were weaving goods of various rather
common kinds and many of the women were kept
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
busy spinning thread and woolen yarns for cloth.
Money was scarce, most of the trade was carried on
by barter.</p>

<p>"It has the making of a magnificent city," Bernard
Carrick said, surveying its many fine points. "From
here you will go straight over to the Mississippi.
Some day we shall have both sides. What have the
French been about to let such a splendid opportunity
slip through their hands."</p>

<p>"Don't stir up a hornet's nest at home," counseled
the elder Carrick.</p>

<p>"Oh, you mean great-grandfather! He sees the
mistakes and shortsightedness, and while he would
have been proud enough to live here under French
rule, he understands some aspects at the old home
better than we, the extravagance of the Court, the corruption
of society, and," laughing, "he is hardly as hot
for France as you are for England. After all, what
so much has been done for you or Scotland or Ireland
for that matter?"</p>

<p>"This will be fought all over again. You will see.
The country will be broken up into little provinces.
Yankee and Virginian will never agree;
Catholic and Puritan are bound to fight each
other."</p>

<p>"Hardly! They fought together for the great cause
and they'll hardly turn their swords on each other.
I've been from New York to Yorktown. And now the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
great work is for every man to improve his own holding,
his own town."</p>

<p>Pittsburg then had enjoyed or hated successive
rulers. Great Britain, then France, Great Britain
again, Virginia and Pennsylvania. It had been a
strategic point worth holding, but no one then had
dreamed of its later renown.</p>

<p>Bernard Carrick did not seem to make much headway
with his little daughter. She had been startled
with his rudeness, though he was gentle enough now.
But what with her mother, grandad, and Norah, who
was the most charming of stepmothers, she felt he
had enough care and attention. She was not going
to sue for any favors.</p>

<p>"Daffodil," he said one pleasant day when they had
been rambling round the old Block House, not so very
old then, though it could count on over twenty years,
"Daffodil, why can't you love me as well as you love
great-grandfather. I think you scarcely love me at
all."</p>

<p>She kicked some gravelly stones out of her path
and looked over the river. It was all so beautiful then,
no smoke to obscure it anywhere.</p>

<p>"They all love you, they're always wanting you.
Grandad doesn't care for me any more. And he
wasn't a bit glad when the news came. He went in the
house saying it was a 'lee' and Norry said the black
cat was on his back. It wasn't a real cat, but like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
those in the stories. And he stayed there all day.
And he wouldn't believe you were coming home or
that the war was ended."</p>

<p>"He hardly believes it yet;" laughing. "But he
<i>was</i> glad to have me come back. And are you not a
little glad?"</p>

<p>"You have all mother's gladness. And gran'mere's."</p>

<p>She made a funny little movement with her dimpled
chin, that if she had been older would have been
coquettish. Her lashes were long and a sort of bronze
brown, and her eyes made a glitter through them.
Barbe had been a very pretty girl but the child was
not much like her mother only in certain dainty ways.
And her blue eyes came from him. He was rather
glad of that.</p>

<p>"Don't you want them to be glad that I am back?"</p>

<p>"Why?"&mdash;she looked up perplexed. She was not
old enough to define her emotions. "Of course I
should want them to be glad."</p>

<p>"Yet you are a little jealous."</p>

<p>"Jealous!" she repeated. The word had no clearly
definite meaning to her.</p>

<p>"Maybe I have crowded you out a little. But you
will find as you grow that there is a great deal of
love that can be given and not make any one the
poorer."</p>

<p>"What is jealousy?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span></p>

<p>She had been following out her own thought and
hardly minded his truism.</p>

<p>"Why"&mdash;how could he define it to the child's
limited understanding? "Jealousy is wanting <i>all</i> of
another's regard and not being willing that any other
shall have a share. Not being willing that grandad
shall care for me."</p>

<p>"He wasn't glad at first." She could not forget
that.</p>

<p>"It wasn't a question of wanting or not wanting
me that made him captious. He could not enjoy the
English being beaten. I do not understand that in
him since he means to spend all the rest of his life
here, and has never wanted to go back. He was only
a little boy, not older than you when he came here.
And he fought in the battle of Braddock's defeat.
Though the French gained the day it was no
great victory for them, for they gave up their plan of
taking possession of all the country here about. And
he has not much faith in the rebels, as he used to call
us, and didn't see what we wanted to fight for. And
he <i>is</i> glad to have me back. But he isn't going to love
you any less."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes he does," she returned quickly. "I used
to ride with him and he never asks me now. And he
takes you away&mdash;then they all come asking for you
and if everybody likes you so much&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And don't you like me a little?" He gave a soft,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
wholesome laugh and it teased her. She hung her
head and returned rather doubtfully&mdash;"I don't
know."</p>

<p>"Oh, and you are my one little girl! I love you
dearly. Are you not glad to have me come back and
bring all my limbs? For some poor fellows have left
an arm or a leg on the battlefield. Suppose I had to
walk with a crutch like poor old Pete Nares?"</p>

<p>She stopped short and viewed him from head to
foot. "No, I shouldn't like it," she returned decisively.</p>

<p>"But you would feel sorry for me?"</p>

<p>"You couldn't dance then. And grandad tells of
your dancing and that you and mother looked so
pretty, that you could dance longer and better than
any one. And he was quite sure you would come home
all&mdash;all&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"All battered up. But I think he and Norry would
have been very good to me. And mother and everybody.
And now say you love me a little."</p>

<p>"I was afraid of you," rather reluctantly. "You
were not like&mdash;oh, you were so strange."</p>

<p>What an elusive little thing she was!</p>

<p>"But you are not afraid now. I think I never
heard of a little girl who didn't love her father."</p>

<p>"But you see the fathers stay home with them.
There are the Mullin children and the Boyles. But I
shouldn't like Mr. Boyle for a father."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span></p>

<p>"Why?" with a touch of curiosity.</p>

<p>"Oh, because&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Andy Boyle seems very nice and jolly. We used
to be great friends. And he gave me a warm welcome."</p>

<p>"I can't like him;" emphatically. "He beat
Teddy."</p>

<p>"I suppose Teddy was bad. Children are not always
good. What would you have done if you had
been Teddy?" he asked with a half smile.</p>

<p>"I would&mdash;I would have bitten his hand, the one
that struck. And then I should have run away, out
in the woods and frozen to death, maybe."</p>

<p>"Why my father thrashed me and I know I deserved
it. And you are not going to hate grandad
for it?"</p>

<p>She raised her lovely eyes and looked him all over.
"Were you very little?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;I think I wasn't very good as a boy."</p>

<p>"Then I don't like grandad as well. I'm bigger
than Judy, but do you suppose I would beat her?"</p>

<p>"But if she went in the pantry and stole something?"</p>

<p>"Can you steal things in your own house?"</p>

<p>"Oh what a little casuist you are. But we haven't
settled the other question&mdash;are you going to love
me?"</p>

<p>"I can't tell right away;" reluctantly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, I am going to love you. You are all the
little girl I have."</p>

<p>"But you have all the other people."</p>

<p>He laughed good-naturedly. She was very amusing
in her unreason. And unlike most children he had
seen she held her love rather high.</p>

<p>"I shall get a horse," he said, "and you will ride
with me. And when the spring fairly comes in we
will take walks and find wild flowers and watch the
birds as they go singing about. Maybe I can think
up some stories to tell you. I am going to be very
good to you for I want you to love me."</p>

<p>She seemed to consider. Then she saw grandad,
who had a little squirrel in his hands. Some of them
were very tame, so she ran to look at it.</p>

<p>"A queer little thing," said the father to himself.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />
<br />
OLD PITTSBURG</h2>

<p>Spring came with a rush. Barbe Carrick glanced out
of the south window one morning and called her little
girl.</p>

<p>"Look, Dilly, the daffodils are opening and they
make the garden fairly joyous. They are like the
sun."</p>

<p>There was a long border of them. The green stalks
stood up stiff like guards and the yellow heads nodded
as if they were laughing. Wild hyacinths were showing
color as well, but these were the first save a few
snowdrops and violets one found in woody nooks.
Birds were singing and flying to and fro in search of
nesting places.</p>

<p>Pittsburg was not much of a town then, but its
surroundings were beautiful. The two rivers were
rushing and foaming now in their wild haste to pour
their overflow into the Ohio. The houses had begun
to stretch out beyond the Fort. Colonel Campbell
some years before had laid out several streets, the
nucleus of the coming city. Then Thomas Hickory
completed the plans and new houses were in the
course of erection. Still the great business of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
time was in the hands of the Indian traders that the
French had found profitable. Beyond were farms, and
the great tract, afterward to be Allegheny City, lay in
fields and woods.</p>

<p>A post road had been ordered by the government
between Philadelphia and the town. And there were
plans for a paper. For now most people were convinced
that the war was at an end, and the Southern
cities had been turned over to the Continental government.</p>

<p>There was a brisk, stirring air pervading the place.
Business projects were discussed. Iron had been discovered,
in fact the whole land was rich in minerals.
The traders were bringing down their furs. It had
not been a specially cold winter and in this latitude the
spring came earlier.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's beautiful!" The child clapped her hands.
"Can't I bring in some of them?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. But pick only the largest ones. Leave
the others on to grow."</p>

<p>She came in with an apron full. "Some are for
grandfather," she said.</p>

<p>"Yes, fill this bowl and put it on his table."</p>

<p>She had just finished when he came out. He was
always immaculate, and his hair had the silvery tint.
His daughter saw that it was always neatly brushed
and the queue tied with a black ribbon. He was
growing a trifle thinner and weaker.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, little one," he cried, "did you get a posy for
me? Is it your birthday?" and he stooped to kiss the
golden hair, then the rosy lips.</p>

<p>"Her birthday will not be until next week," said
her mother.</p>

<p>"I had forgotten. I am almost a hundred. And
she is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Seven."</p>

<p>"And when I get to be a hundred I'll have a little
table like yours, and read out of the Bible, and we'll
talk over things that happened when we were children."</p>

<p>He laughed and patted her shoulder. "I shall not
be here," he said slowly.</p>

<p>"Oh, where are you going? I do not want you to
go away," and she drew an apprehensive breath.</p>

<p>"We do not always stay in one place. I came
from France years and years ago. And I shall go
to another country, heaven. It is always summer
there."</p>

<p>"Can't you take me?" with an eager, upward look.</p>

<p>"Mother wants you. And you are to be a little old
lady and sit in this chair."</p>

<p>"And wear a cap like gran'mere? And have two
little creases in my forehead, so?"</p>

<p>She tried to make them but they were not much of
a success, and the smile returned. "Now let us
read."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span></p>

<p>She took her seat on the arm of the chair. Gran'mere
came in and busied herself about breakfast.
The reading was from one of the minor prophets.
Dilly did not understand it very well but she could
converse in the language quite fluently. Her mother
had taught her to spell and read English. Girls were
not expected to have much education in those days;
indeed, here they grew up mostly like the flowers of
the field. While the little girls to the eastward were
working samplers, sewing long overhand seams,
hemming, and doing beautiful darning, these little
girls ran about, romped, helped to take care of the
next younger baby, grew up and married, no one
could have told just how.</p>

<p>After breakfast when the sun was warm and bright
grandfather started for his walk. He always felt
stronger in the morning. Sometimes Barbe went,
often only Dilly. He liked the child's prattle. He
liked, too, the way the denizens of the woods came to
her, and the birds. True she always had some bread
to crumble and she talked in her low sunny voice.
Now and then a squirrel would run up her shoulder,
watch her with beady eyes that almost laughed and
whisk his feathery tail about.</p>

<p>"It does seem as if they ought to talk," she often
said.</p>

<p>"They do in their language, only we can't understand
them; at least we do in part. Doesn't he say in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
his fashion, 'I'm glad to see you? Have you any
crumbs to-day.' And how one of them scolded when
another ran off with that piece you dropped."</p>

<p>"That was funny, wasn't it!" and she laughed.
They were sitting on a fallen log in the warm sunshine.
Bees were out also, buzzing and no doubt
grumbling a little because there were not more sweet
flowers in bloom. And the birds sang and whistled
in great glee.</p>

<p>They returned from their walk presently through
the woods, where she gathered some curious wild
flowers. Then they came out by the river, foaming
and tumbling about as if it longed to overflow its
banks. Now and then a rough kind of boat came
down laden with stores of some kind, but there was
no hurry visible anywhere.</p>

<p>About sixteen years before the Indians had ceded
all the lands about Pittsburg to the Colonies. The six
nations assembled with their principal chiefs and warriors
and gave the strongest assurance of treaty
keeping, which after all were not well kept, as usual.
But they had retreated to better hunting grounds and
for some time had made little trouble, though many
friendly Indians remained.</p>

<p>The wanderers came out to the town proper.
Streets were being surveyed, straightened, new
ones laid out. There were about a hundred houses
ranged round the Fort, but they had begun to spread
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
outside. The disputes with the Pitt family, who had
held the charter of Pennsylvania, had been mostly
settled and grants of land given to many of the returned
soldiers in lieu of the money the Colonial
government could not pay. Pittsburg now belonged
to the State, and a project had been broached to
make it the county seat.</p>

<p>Grandfather looked very tired and pale as he came
in and went straight to his chair. His daughter took
his hat and cane.</p>

<p>"I did not mean to go so far. I wanted to look
at the spot where I had buried my money;" with a
little hollow laugh.</p>

<p>"Did you bury some money?" asked Daffodil,
with eager curiosity. "Can't you dig it up again?"</p>

<p>"No, dear; it has to stay there for years. It
may be dug up in your time, but I shall not need
it."</p>

<p>She looked puzzled.</p>

<p>"You must have a cup of tea," said Mrs. Bradin,
and immediately she set about it. Grandfather leaned
back in his chair and closed his eyes. Dilly espied
her mother in the adjoining room and went thither
to exploit the splendid time with the squirrels and
show the flowers she had gathered. Then she stood
rather wistfully.</p>

<p>"Well?" said her mother in a tone of inquiry.</p>

<p>"Grandfather went to look at the money he had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
buried, but he couldn't find it. Do you suppose some
one has taken it away?"</p>

<p>"Buried?" She seemed mystified a moment, then
smiled. "It wasn't as we bury things. A long time
ago when the French held the Fort and seemed
likely to keep a good part of the country grandfather
bought a large tract of land. Then the French were
driven out by the English and they in their turn by
the Colonists. But the land is there and some day
the money may come out of it. Grandad thinks he
might as well have thrown it into the river. But
he has never wanted for anything, and it would likely
have been spent for something else. It's odd grandfather
should have said that to-day. He seldom mentions
it. He was quite troubled over it at first&mdash;when
<i>I</i> was a little girl."</p>

<p>"Oh," returned Daffodil, relieved, though she did
not understand the matter.</p>

<p>"Go and put your flowers in water;" said her
mother.</p>

<p>Grandfather was soundly asleep and did not wake
until dinner was on the table. Then he scarcely
tasted it.</p>

<p>"You must not take such long walks," his daughter
said. "You cannot stand it any more."</p>

<p>"No, I am getting old," rather sadly. "When your
mother died I felt that I didn't want to live, and now
I am content to go on in this lovely world until the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
Lord calls me home. I thought once I should round
out the century. There have been many changes in
the hundred years."</p>

<p>And though he had been on exile for his faith's
sake, though he had seen the blunders and sins of
his country's rulers, he could not help reverting to
the grand old dream of the magnificent empire of
New France that would never come to pass now.
How they had let all the advantages slip through
their fingers that had grasped only at the wildest
pleasures and dissipations.</p>

<p>Barbe went out in the sunshine to garden a little.
She was so fond of growing and blooming things.
And they yielded such a beautiful return. She sang
snatches of songs, sometimes in French, sometimes
the gay or sad Scotch ditties. Dilly went over to
see Norah, all the men were out now at the spring
work. Norah was spinning on the big wheel, but
she could raise her voice above its whir and to-day
she was full of merry legends. Dilly had brought
the cat and Judy never objected to being held.</p>

<p>"I'm going to be seven years old," she said in a
pause. "And when will I be almost a hundred like
great-grandfather?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you've gone only a little bit toward it,"
laughed Norah. "Why I'm not half way there myself.
And I don't want to be. I'd like never to grow
any older. But you shouldn't stop at seven. You
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
haven't come to the cream of life. There's more fun
at seventeen and that's ten years away. But you're
big enough to have a party."</p>

<p>"What is a party like?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you little innocent! A party is a lot of people
together who laugh and tell stories and have a good
time and something to eat and drink. And you
must have a cake with seven candles around it."</p>

<p>"What are the candles for?"</p>

<p>"To light your way;" laughing. "No, to tell
how many years you have lived. I'll make the cake,
and the candles too. They'll have to be dips for I
haven't any small mould. Don't you remember how
your mother and gran'mere made candles last fall?
And I haven't a bit of wax myrtle. Oh, I can melt
up two or three of mine. They are more fragrant
than tallow. Yes, you shall have a party. I'll talk
to your mother about it."</p>

<p>Dilly was all interest and excitement. Her mother
agreed at once. A modern little girl would have
refused such a party. For there would be all grown
people. Barbe Carrick had been a little exclusive
with her child and she had not felt the need of playmates.
Then they were rather out of the range of
the Fort people as the somewhat crowded settlement
was called. There were no schools nor Sunday-schools
for little folks. Sunday was not very strictly
kept. The schoolmaster read prayers, the litany, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
a sermon from some volume on Sunday morning and
the rest of the day was given over to social life.
There were a few Friends who held their meeting in
each other's houses; some of the Acadians had found
their way thither, and now and then a priest came
who took in the more devout of the Irish population.
But there was a large liberty of opinion.</p>

<p>Norah would have the house decorated with blossoming
shrubs and she made a wreath for the little
girl to wear, for a few neighbors were asked in.
James Langdale had been in Bernard's company, and
Mrs. Langdale and Barbe had exchanged many a
fear and a few hopes. There were two Langdale
boys, but of course they were not eligible for a girl's
party.</p>

<p>They had some idea of the fitness of things even
then. Barbe and Bernard Carrick were at the head
of the table with Daffodil on her mother's side and
great-grandfather on the other. At the foot were
grandfather and grandmother Bradin and on one side
grandfather Carrick and Norah, fresh and smiling
and full of gayety in the pretty lavender cr√™pe she
had worn at her own wedding and that she saved
now for high occasions, with her sapphire earrings
and brooch that had come down to her through several
generations and had been worn at Court and
danced with royalty.</p>

<p>It was what we would call a high tea, a bountiful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
spread, and there was much jesting and joking. I
think they didn't mind the little girl very much. She
was perched up higher than usual and wore a white
robe that was kept as a sort of heirloom when she
outgrew it, for it was lace and needlework of her
mother's making.</p>

<p>Jetty, a half Indian woman, waited on the table,
and when the meats were taken out and the dessert
brought in there was Daffodil's beautiful cake with
the seven candles all alight. She thrilled with the
pleasure. They passed around other cakes and
home-made wine and drank great-grandfather's health
and wished him many more years. Grandfather Carrick
drank to Daffodil's future, wishing her long life
and a happy marriage with great prosperity.</p>

<p>Then her mother helped her up on her feet. She
felt very bashful with everybody's eyes upon her and
almost forgot the little speech Norah had taught her,
but her mother prompted and she replied amid great
applause. The toasting went all around, then her
candles were put out and she had to cut the cake,
which she did with a silver knife that had a Louis
stamp upon it. The cake was declared excellent.</p>

<p>"I'm going to take my piece home to the boys,"
declared Mrs. Langdale. "Husband, give me a taste
of yours."</p>

<p>After that there was more merriment. Then Jetty
took off the things, the tables were pushed back, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
Norah and grandfather Carrick danced a jig. And
it <i>was</i> dancing such as you seldom see nowadays.
Norah could have made her fortune on a modern
stage.</p>

<p>After Daffodil's party broke up the men went over
to grandfather Carrick's, where they made a night
of it, as was the fashion of the times. But Dilly and
great-grandfather wanted to go to bed.</p>

<p>"A party is just beautiful!" declared Dilly.
"Couldn't I have another sometime!"</p>

<p>"Oh, you are getting spoiled," laughed her mother.
"Let me see&mdash;when you are ten, maybe."</p>

<p>So many new thoughts came to Daffodil that she
was surprised at herself. Of course it was being
seven years old. She began to sew a little and knit
and make lace over a cushion. Very simple at first,
and oh, the mistakes! Then there was gardening.
How curious to plant a dainty little seed and have it
poke a green head out of the ground. But funniest
of all were the beans coming up with their shells on
their heads; she was sure at first they must be upside
down.</p>

<p>The men were very busy about the new town and
sometimes they almost quarreled over the improvements.
It was taking on quite a changed aspect.
They were giving names to the streets and building
much better houses of hewn logs, making plaster
walls. But glass was very dear and for a long while
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
they could only put in a few windows. The rest were
openings, closed by shutters at night or in a storm.</p>

<p>The paper was a great source of interest, the Pittsburg
<i>Gazette</i>. What they did without any telegraph
and depending only on post horses puzzles us now.
And the General Government had a hard task on its
hands reconciling the different states and trying ways
of getting money.</p>

<p>"They'll see, an' a sorry time they'll have of it,"
predicted Sandy Carrick. "It's settin' up housekeeping
for yourself on nothing. Th' ould country's paid our
bills and sent us what we needed an' they'll be glad
to go back, mark my words now."</p>

<p>Bernard took his father's talk in good part. His
knowledge was so much wider. There would be hard
times, but there were brave men to meet it. Sometimes
he wished they could go to a big city, but it
would be cruel to tear Barbe away from the household
when she was its light.</p>

<p>Daffodil had another wonderful pleasure. The old
English people kept up some of their customs and they
had a gay time over the Maypole. It was like a grand
picnic. They had a smooth grassy place at the edge
of the woods and the pole was a young tree that was
denuded of its limbs as it stood in just the right place.
They could not get ribbon, but strips of dyed muslin
answered for the streamers. There were two fiddlers,
there were gay choruses. One song grandad sang
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
with great gusto. Captious as he could be when
people did not agree with him, he had a fund of Irish
drollery.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Come, lasses and lads, get leave of your dads</p>
<p class="i1">And away to the Maypole hie;</p>
<p>For every fair has a sweetheart there,</p>
<p class="i1">And the fiddlers standing by,</p>
<p>Then trip it, trip it, up and down."</p>
</div></div>

<p>And grandad did trip it merrily. It was fortunate
for Norah that she was not jealous, but she enjoyed
a bit of fun, and her arch smile, the merry flash of her
eyes, with the color coming and going, made her very
attractive. Dilly wished she was big enough to dance&mdash;her
little feet kept patting the turf and keeping time
with the fiddle.</p>

<p>"You're Daffodil Carrick, aren't you?" said a boyish
voice almost in her ear.</p>

<p>She turned, startled, and her eyes were so lovely
they fairly transfixed him, and she stared unconsciously.</p>

<p>She did not speak but nodded.</p>

<p>"I'm Ned Langdale. My mother was at your party
and brought us home a piece of your birthday cake.
She said you were seven and as pretty as a fairy, and
I'm fourteen, just twice as old."</p>

<p>"Oh," she said, "that's funny. And will you always
be twice as old."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span></p>

<p>"Why&mdash;no. You can never be that but just once
in your life&mdash;I mean with that special person. And
when you were twenty I wouldn't like to be forty."</p>

<p>"Is that so very old? Great-grandfather is ninety-seven."</p>

<p>"Whew! That is old! But you see now I am
seven years older than you and that is the way it will
be all our lives. Do you go to school? There's a lady
in Water Street who takes little girls, though she's only
just begun."</p>

<p>"No; but I can spell, and read, and do little sums.
And read in French."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's great! I'm studying Latin, but it's
awful tough. Isn't it gay here? Can you dance?"</p>

<p>"I never tried with music."</p>

<p>"I can, just a little. Oh, say, it's splendid! If I
knew just how I'd ask you to try it with me. It seems
so easy when you look at them. It's so and so&mdash;&mdash;"
moving his hands. "Yes, do try. You whirl
round&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>And without any real intention they started. It
was like floating. Yes, she had done it when she
thought of the little people dancing on the green.</p>

<p>"Oh," with a soft laugh of protest, and all out of
breath. "It's&mdash;delicious! I didn't think I could do
it for fair. I sometimes make believe. I'll get Norry
to teach me."</p>

<p>"Norry? Who?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span></p>

<p>"Why&mdash;&mdash;" she flushed daintily. "That's grandad's
wife."</p>

<p>"Then she's your grandmother."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, she isn't. You see the other wife died;
she was father's mother and he married Norah. We
all call her Norry."</p>

<p>"She doesn't look old enough to be any one's grandmother.
And isn't she gay? She has such a merry
face, pretty too."</p>

<p>"And she sings such gay songs. She knows all
about the fairies, too, and she's seen them at home,
that's Ireland. Why don't they come to America?"</p>

<p>"Maybe the witches drive them away. Witches are
just awful! Come; let us try again."</p>

<p>He placed his arm around her and they whirled off
to the fascinating music. Is there anything like a
fiddle to put the spirit of delight in one's feet? Other
couples were floating round or doing jigs with fancy
steps and laughter. Now and then a bright, mirthful
young lad ran off with some girl and left the first partner
in the lurch, at which there was a shout.</p>

<p>"Oh, I wish you were my sister! Wouldn't we
have fun! I have only one brother, Archie, and he's
stupid as an owl&mdash;well, I mean he hasn't any fun in
him, and he'd dance about like a cow. Oh, there's
your&mdash;well, it would be queer to call her grandmother."</p>

<p>They both laughed at that.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span></p>

<p>"I wondered where you were, Daffodil. Isn't this
Ned Langdale? I know your mother. Dilly, I think
I had better take you home. I promised your mother
I wouldn't keep you very long."</p>

<p>"Oh, no; let me stay just a little while. It's all so
gay and they dance so&mdash;so&mdash;isn't it like a fairy
ring?"</p>

<p>Norah laughed. "Well, I'll take another round,
then we must go. You keep her just about here, then
I shall know where to find you. Aren't you tired,
though?"</p>

<p>"Oh, not a bit."</p>

<p>Her eyes shone like stars and there was a most
delicious color in her cheeks like the dainty first
ripeness of a peach.</p>

<p>"There's a tree over there&mdash;go and sit down. I
won't be long."</p>

<p>The great tree had been cut down and there were
no end of chips lying about.</p>

<p>"Now, if I was home I'd get a basket and gather
them up," said Ned. "Mother thinks they make such
a splendid fire. It's odd that our fathers were out in
the war together, and are real good friends. I mean
to be a soldier."</p>

<p>"But if there isn't any war?"</p>

<p>"There'll be Indian wars until they are all cleared
out. They're a treacherous lot and never keep their
word. And governments need an army all the time."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span></p>

<p>"But it's dreadful to fight and kill each other."</p>

<p>"Still you have to. History is full of wars. And
there were so many in the Bible times. The children
of Israel had to fight so many people to get the land
of Canaan that the Lord promised them. And we've
been fighting for a country&mdash;that is, our fathers have&mdash;and
now we've gained it. Oh, wasn't it splendid
when Cornwallis surrendered. Did you hear Kirsty
that morning? I thought the place was on fire."</p>

<p>That brought grandad's face before her and she
laughed.</p>

<p>"I didn't know what it meant nor who Cornwallis
was. I'm only a little girl&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But you're awful smart to read French. Can you
talk it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. Grandmother Bradin was French. They
went to Ireland and then came to America, and since
father has been away they have talked it a great deal
more, so you see I know both."</p>

<p>"Mother said your party was so nice. And the old
grandfather was like a picture. When they drank
your health you had to reply."</p>

<p>Daffodil's face was scarlet.</p>

<p>"I almost forgot. Norry made me say it over and
over, but mother whispered and then I remembered."</p>

<p>"Oh, I wish I could have seen you. And you are so
little and pretty. I'd like to see your French grandfather.
Could I come some time?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, yes. And you'd like Norry so much."</p>

<p>"Do they live with you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no; but it's only a little way off&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Norah came flying back. "Come," she said hurriedly.
"Grandad's had a fit about you because I did
not have you tucked under my wing. Why, I should
have dropped you while I was dancing. Glad you've
taken such good care of her;" and Norah nodded to
him as she took the child by the hand. "Don't say
a word about the lad, or grandad will show his claws
and scratch all round."</p>

<p>He was waiting where a path turned off.</p>

<p>"Well, Yellow-top," he began, "so you're not lost.
Had a good time?"</p>

<p>"I was watching them dance. And they were so
merry. Oh it was fine!"</p>

<p>"No place for a little youngster like you. Norry
was crazy to think of it."</p>

<p>"I saw some other little children&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, rabble;" and the nose went up.</p>

<p>"Grandad, don't be cross. I had such a nice time;"
and she slipped her small hand in his.</p>

<p>"You're 'most a witch, you cunning little thing;"
and he gave her a squeeze. "Now, Norry, take her
to her mother's arms before you let her go."</p>

<p>They turned off, and grandad, who had not had his
fun out, went back.</p>

<p>"It was all splendid, Norry. I want you to show
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
me how to dance and teach me some songs&mdash;some of
those gay and pretty ones."</p>

<p>"Well, well! you <i>are</i> getting along. Daffodil Carrick,
you'll break hearts some day;" and Norah
laughed.</p>

<p>She had so much to tell them at home and she spoke
of Ned Langdale, but she did not quite like to tell
about the dancing, wondering if there had been anything
wrong in it, and she did not want to have Norah
blamed. She liked the gayety so much. It was
rather grave at home, with all grown people. And
her mother was not <i>all</i> hers now. Father was very
fond of her. And she was coming to like him very
much.</p>

<p>He was pleased that she had such a nice time. He
wondered if it would not be well to send her to this
school for small children that had lately been opened.
But her mother objected decidedly.</p>

<p>Oh, how beautiful the summer was with its flowers,
and then its fruits. One Sunday afternoon Mr. and
Mrs. Langdale came up with their son Edward, and
Daffodil was glad to see him again. He was a nice,
well-behaved lad, and very deferential to great-grandfather.
The two soldiers talked over their battles
and the state of the country. The preliminaries
of peace were under way, but the settlement seemed
to drag along. France still stood our friend.</p>

<p>Daffodil took him out to see the squirrels that came
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
at her call and inspected him with such curious, inquiring
eyes that he laughed about it.</p>

<p>"You see they are not used to boys," she explained.</p>

<p>The quails were very much at their ease as well, and
robins flew and fluttered. Judy never tried to catch
them, though sometimes she hunted out in the woods.</p>

<p>"Ned Langdale is a nice boy," said Dilly's father.
"I don't wonder they are proud of him. His heart
is set on being a soldier."</p>

<p>"I'm glad he isn't my son if that is his bent,"
Barbe said. "And I hope we'll hear no more of war."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br />
<br />
HOW THE WORLD WIDENED</h2>

<p>The summer passed rapidly. Daffodil found many
things to entertain her, but grandfather demanded
much of her time. He took his morning walk with
her hand in his, but he did not go as far as formerly.
Then, on his return, he had a nap in his chair. He
lost his appetite during the latter part of the season.
In the afternoon he took a long nap. Daffodil read to
him now, and he did not appear to notice her blunders.</p>

<p>"Father fails rapidly, I think," Mrs. Bradin said
to her husband.</p>

<p>He shook his head with a slow, sympathetic movement.</p>

<p>"We shall miss him very much. And Dilly will
feel it. I am sorry to have her know the mystery no
child can understand."</p>

<p>"We won't go for a walk this morning, Dilly," he
said one day in later August. "The air is very close.
We will wait until evening."</p>

<p>"But you go to bed so early."</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm getting old," with his faint, sweet
smile.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span></p>

<p>"But everybody says you must live to be a hundred.
That's a whole century."</p>

<p>"Sometimes I feel as if it were two centuries since
I began. But it has been a pleasant journey toward
the last. I'm glad to have had you, Dilly."</p>

<p>"I'm glad, too," the child said with her bright
smile.</p>

<p>"Now you may sing to me a little."</p>

<p>So she sang him to sleep. Then she went to wait on
her grandmother. Her mother was sewing by the
window in their sleeping-room.</p>

<p>"Go and look at grandfather," she said presently.</p>

<p>"He is still asleep. Mother, I wish you would
show me that stitch I began yesterday."</p>

<p>So she sat down at her work.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bradin went to her father. His head had
drooped a little forward. She placed her hand on his
forehead, and drew a long quivering breath. The
summons had come, peacefully, for him.</p>

<p>She was still standing there when her husband entered,
and at a glance he knew what had happened.</p>

<p>"It is best so," he said.</p>

<p>Barbe was startled beyond measure. Latterly her
thoughts had been revolving much about herself, and
though she had remarked the slow alteration, she had
put off the assumption of the great change. Somewhere
in the winter&mdash;maybe spring, and here it was
with the ripening of summer.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span></p>

<p>They carried him to his room and laid him tenderly
on his bed. A long, well-used life it had been.</p>

<p>To Daffodil it was a profound mystery. No child
could comprehend it. This was the journey grandfather
had spoken of, that she had imagined going
back to France.</p>

<p>"What is it, mother? How do people go to
heaven?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Some day we will talk it all over, when you can
understand better. We must all go sometime. And
we shall see each other there."</p>

<p>"Then it isn't so bad as never seeing one again,"
and there was a great tremble in her voice.</p>

<p>"No, dear. And God knows about the best times.
We must trust to that."</p>

<p>He looked so peaceful the day of the burial that Daffodil
thought he must be simply asleep. She said
good-by to him softly. There had been no tragedy
about it, but a quiet, reverent passing away.</p>

<p>Still, they missed him very much. Barbe wanted to
set away the chair that had been so much to him.
She could not bear to see it empty.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, mother," pleaded Daffodil. "When I go
and sit in it I can talk to him, and he seems to come
back and answer me. It's so lovely where he is and
there isn't any winter. Think of having flowers all the
year round. And no one ever is ill. There are such
beautiful walks, and woods full of birds, the like of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
which one never sees here. And I can put my head
down on his shoulder, just as I used, and I can feel
his hand holding mine. Oh, no, don't take it away,
for then I should lose him."</p>

<p>The child's eyes had a wonderful exalted light in
them, and her voice had a tender, appealing sound,
that went to the mother's heart. She was thankful, too,
that Daffodil had no terror of death. She shrank from
it as from some dread spectre standing in her way.</p>

<p>The child missed him most in her walks. Norah
liked neighbors to chaff and gossip with; rambles, with
no special motive, did not appeal to her. Gran'mere
was always busy, her mother was easily tired out.
She rode, as of old, with grandad, but she could not
use the pillion, her arms were too short to go around
his stout body. Her father took her out with him
when he could; he did a good deal of surveying. On
Saturday Ned Langdale would hunt them up, and one
day he brought Archie, who was three years younger,
and not exactly stupid, either, but always wanting to
examine the beginning of things, and how the Indians
came to own the continent, and why the Africans
were black and had woolly hair and in the country
called Asia they were yellow? And if God created
only two at first, how did they come to be so different?
And how did Adam know what to name the animals?
Were there people living in the stars?</p>

<p>"Oh, do hush up," his mother would exclaim impatiently.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
"You are enough to turn one's brain upside
down! And you can't say half the multiplication
table. I don't believe you know how many black
beans make five!"</p>

<p>It had been a great puzzle to him. He sprung it
on Daffodil one day.</p>

<p>She considered. "Why, five would be five of anything,
wouldn't it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, how quick you are with a good reason, too.
I couldn't see into it for ever so long. I'm awful
dull."</p>

<p>Then they both laughed. His face was such a good
honest one, but not full of mirth, like Ned's.</p>

<p>They were really nice boys, and her father felt he
could trust her with them. But he wished there
were some tolerably well trained girls for her to
know.</p>

<p>Then the winter came on again. Her father had
to go to Philadelphia on some business, and there were
stirring times in the brave old city. They missed
him so much. Grandfather Bradin was promoted to
the whole name now, as there was no chance of confusion,
but the little girl as often endearingly called
him "gran."</p>

<p>Bernard Carrick brought home with him great-grandfather's
will that had been made five years before,
and intrusted to a legal friend, who was, like
himself, a Huguenot refugee. To his wife Felix
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
Duvernay had entrusted his strong box, with the gold
pieces that were almost heirlooms, and various jewels,
to do with whatever she chose. There were some
deeds of property that he brought home with him, and
the will.</p>

<p>"I was amazed," he said to Barbe. "Why, there
are acres and acres of ground that will be worth a
mint of money some day. And it is all securely made
over to Daffodil Carrick. Your father and I are appointed
guardians, and this Mr. de Ronville is administrator.
His father was exiled about the same time,
but he came at once to America. It seems a little
queer that great-grandfather shouldn't have made
more of it."</p>

<p>"I think, after the purchase he felt rather sore
about it, as if it was a foolish bargain. But he
thought then that the French would be the real rulers
of America," said Mrs. Bradin. "Yet he never alluded
to the will; and you know he was always very fond
of Dilly, and that there was no other child."</p>

<p>"Dear old man! When Dilly is grown up she will
be an heiress. It can only be leased until she comes
of age. I wish it was on this side of the river. Well,
as my father says, 'it will neither eat nor drink,' except
the rains of heaven. We won't proclaim it on the
housetops."</p>

<p>So matters went on just the same. No one gave
much thought to "over the river" then.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span></p>

<p>One morning Mrs. Carrick was not very well.
Norah came over, and there was grave consulting.
She took Dilly back with her, and in the afternoon
grandad bundled her up and drove her over to the
mill with him, and was very jolly. They did not return
until dusk, and then Norry's supper had such a
savory fragrance she decided to share it. Norry had
been over to the other house, and "mother" had a bad
headache, and Dilly was to stay all night. She had
brought over her nightgown.</p>

<p>"That's funny!" exclaimed Daffodil. "Mother
seldom has a headache. Oh," with a sudden alarm,
"you don't think mother will be ill for weeks and
weeks, and grow pale and thin, as she did before father
came home."</p>

<p>"Oh, no;" and Norry threw up her head with a
laugh. "She'll be up again in no time."</p>

<p>Grandad was teaching the little girl to play checkers,
and she was deeply interested. Norry was knitting
a long woollen stocking for him, and sang bits of gay
Irish songs. But by and by the little girl began to
yawn, and made some bad plays.</p>

<p>"You're sleepy," said grandad.</p>

<p>"Yes, I can't get over to the king row;" and she
smiled. "But you just wait until to-morrow, when
I'm bright and fresh."</p>

<p>So Norry put her to bed, and, leaving grandad to
read the <i>Gazette</i>, she ran over to see how it fared with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
Barbe, and did not come home until morning.
Grandad had a nice fire, and had made the coffee.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear," began Daffodil, coming out in her
trained nightgown, as they made garments for children
to grow in, in those days, "isn't it funny? When I
woke up I couldn't think where I was, and it came
into my mind about little Bridget, that fairies took
away for seven years. Then I would be fourteen."</p>

<p>"That's some of Norry's nonsense. Get on your
clothes, and come and have these grand griddle cakes
and sausage, that'll make you sing in your sleep."</p>

<p>"Why not when I am awake?" with laughing eyes.</p>

<p>"Anybody can do that. But it takes something
extra good to make you sing in your sleep."</p>

<p>She thought they were quite good enough, and
wondered how it would seem to sing in the night, and
the dark, and if she could hear herself.</p>

<p>Then her father came after her. Grandad wrung
his hand and said, "Lad, I wish you joy and the best
of luck."</p>

<p>What did that mean?</p>

<p>"Daffodil, something wonderful has happened to
us, and I hope&mdash;you will like it. We are very happy
over it. We have a little boy who came in the night.
A little brother for you. And we want you to be
glad."</p>

<p>"Oh, was that what grandad meant?" she asked
gravely.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes. You see, girls marry and give up their
name. But a boy carries it on. And grandad hated
to have the name die out. He will be very proud
of the boy, but I think no one will be quite as dear to
him as Daffodil."</p>

<p>The child was revolving various thoughts in her
mind, and made no comment. When they entered the
house, Grandmother Bradin took off her hat and
cloak, and kissed her very fondly. Her father
watched the small serious face. Then he sat down in
the big chair, and took her on his knee.</p>

<p>"Dilly," he began in a pleading tone, "I hope you
won't feel as if&mdash;as if you would be crowded out.
We have had you the longest, and you were our first
sweet joy. We can never love any other child quite
like that. And nothing can ever change our love for
you. So you must not feel jealous because we shall
love him and be glad to have him&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, that was what you said a long time ago, when
you first came home&mdash;that I was jealous. No, I didn't
like mother to love you so much. And you were
strange, and you can't love any one all at once;" incoherently.</p>

<p>"But you are not jealous now?"</p>

<p>"No. It didn't take her love from me, only a little
while."</p>

<p>"It did not take it away at all. And there were
two people to love you, instead of one. Suppose I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
had felt hurt because you loved grandfather so
much?"</p>

<p>"Was it like that?" She raised her lovely eyes
with an appealing light in them. "And was I very
bad?"</p>

<p>He stooped and kissed her. "It was very natural,
and the only thing, the best thing, is to wait until the
other one understands. You love me now?"</p>

<p>She reached up and twined her arms about his
neck.</p>

<p>"I love you very much," she returned in an earnest
tone. "And I am gladder than ever to have you love
me, now that grandfather has gone away. But I
don't want any one else to go."</p>

<p>He clasped her more tightly. No, any other break
in the circle would mean a more poignant grief.
There was no one to spare.</p>

<p>"And you will not mind if we love the little boy
a good deal?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;since it is a little boy. I am glad it is not a
girl, that you chose a boy," she made answer simply.</p>

<p>"We all wanted the boy. Dilly, I am glad to have
you love me, and I hope it will grow stronger as you
grow older, and understand how sweet affection really
is."</p>

<p>Mr. Bradin called him away. He put Daffodil in
the chair and she leaned her head down and whispered
to grandfather that a little boy had come, and she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
was going to be glad, because they all wanted him.
And then a curious thought flashed over her. Death
and life are profound mysteries, even out of childhood.</p>

<p>"Would you like to see the baby?" asked gran'mere
Bradin.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes."</p>

<p>Her mother glanced up out of fond dark eyes.
Why, she was as pale as in her long sickness, but not
so thin. She said, "Kiss me, Daffodil."</p>

<p>"Oh, mother!"</p>

<p>"And here is little brother."</p>

<p>Daffodil's first feeling was disappointment. She
had thought of some angelic beauty. He was red
and crumpled up, and there was a crown of thick
black hair, and his mouth was puckered up. The
mother patted his little face.</p>

<p>"He will look better by and by," she said reassuringly.</p>

<p>"Mother, I was thinking&mdash;it came to me in the
chair&mdash;isn't it old grandfather come back to us again
to live his life over? You know, everything begins
little. The flowers die, but they spring up again,
most of them in the same places."</p>

<p>"Why, child, that is a pretty thought;" and the
mother smiled. "And he will have his name, only
Grandfather Carrick must have his in, so it will be
Alexander Felix Duvernay."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't want him to be called Sandy."</p>

<p>"I think he won't be. And, Daffodil, you won't
mind&mdash;I mean, you won't feel jealous. We wanted
him so much." There was a touch of anxiety in the
mother's voice.</p>

<p>"Oh, no. Father asked me that. No, you may
love him ever so much, while you love me as well."</p>

<p>"She takes it very calmly," said Gran'mere Bradin
afterward. "Some children as old as she, and been
the only one so long, would have made a great fuss.
We have all spoiled her a little, but she has such a
sweet temper. It is the Duvernay temper;" smiling.</p>

<p>"I hope I have a good share of it," resumed Barbe.</p>

<p>The baby was not small, and he grew by the hour.
He had soft, large dark eyes. Grandad did not like
so much French about him, but he was glad to have
a grandson, even at that estate. He soon bleached
out, though he was not fair like Daffodil.</p>

<p>"I'll have to see about making a fortune for him,"
said grandad. "Though those acres of wood and
farmland will not amount to much, and I don't see
what a girl can do with a farm."</p>

<p>But the acres lay smiling in the sunshine, perhaps
dreaming of the time when they should be homes of
beauty.</p>

<p>Meanwhile events had been going on rapidly, if not
harmoniously, for a stable government for the Colonies.
And there must be some sort of a head. A
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
government of the largest liberty it must be, the
states forming a great federation for protection and
advancement. Out of the discussion came the Federal
Constitution, and a President, the man who had
never lost faith in the possibility of a great nation.</p>

<p>There were, of course, a few dissenting voices, and
many fears. For the nation was only an infant.</p>

<p>"What did I tell you," said grandad to his son. He
had to argue, it was one of his satisfactions. "Four
years, they say. In two years the silly things will
make him a king, and in ten years you'll be fighting
for liberty again. There's no money to be had&mdash;we
shall be glad enough to run back to England, and
beg to be taken in. The French will throw us
over."</p>

<p>"Don't look so far ahead." Bernard kept his
temper under these onslaughts. But he did hate to
have his father haranguing little crowds here and
there over the spirits that were being so largely manufactured.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! And have them catch us unprepared.
Where's the money coming from to build a navy, to
pay new soldiers when the old ones are half starving,
to keep your grand President. You see, he'll have a
court and a style, while we common folks can kneel
outside the gates."</p>

<p>"We're going to look out for our own town, and
let the men at the helm take care of the larger interests.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
We have everything for a fine city, and work
for all, so we will take up the nearby business."</p>

<p>People were straggling in; they are generally
gregarious. And there was plenty of work. There
was felling of trees, a sawmill, and rough log houses
were meant for only temporary housing. Wharfs
and docks sprung up by magic. Then the school was
merged into the Pittsburg Academy, afterward to be
the University of Pennsylvania. Smaller schools
came into existence, yet they were a great working
people, and in those years the three R's were esteemed
the most necessary.</p>

<p>Then, after a heated discussion, Pittsburg was
established as the county seat, which enhanced its
prestige. Some rigorous laws were passed, and a
ducking stool was set up at the junction of the three
rivers, much to the disgust of the better classes. At
first there were crowds haunting the place, and
jokes bandied about, but there was found small use
for it.</p>

<p>"It's a good thing," said Sandy Carrick. "It'll
keep the women in check, anyhow."</p>

<p>"Isn't it as well for the men?" asked Norah mischievously.
"An', Sandy, you better look out, ye're
scoldin' about the country 'cause you daren't try much
of it on me. Don't I keep your house clean, mend your
clothes, and knit you long stockings, so's you shan't
get rheumatiz in your knees. An' if you know a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
woman who cooks a better meal of vittles, you had
better go an' board with her."</p>

<p>She was so pretty and saucy that Sandy turned on
his heel and laughed.</p>

<p>Then the <i>Mayflower</i>, with a lot of New England
emigrants, passed Pittsburg for the shores of the
Muskingum.</p>

<p>"Them Eastern states must just have overflowed,"
was the verdict. "Goin' out to Ohio, an' spreadin'
theirselves abroad as bait for the Indians, when there's
civilized lands lyin' about."</p>

<p>And as if Pittsburg was not large enough, they
turned to consider Alleghany, and began to lay it out.
It would make another fine city.</p>

<p>Meanwhile matters went on prosperously, with the
Carricks and the Bradins. Bernard added a room to
his house for Daffodil, and placed a window so she
could see her mother's garden of posies. The baby
grew amazingly, was well and strong, and positively
pretty, looking a little like his mother, getting teeth
without any trouble, walking, saying all manner of
crooked words, and then straightening them, being a
jolly, healthy child, and Norah's heart was bound up
in him. She borrowed him half her time.</p>

<p>"I'd be a happier woman with a houseful of them,"
she said, "Sandy always insisted he didn't care, but
I know he does. He's just ready to eat up little
Sandy without a grain of salt."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span></p>

<p>They <i>would</i> call him that, while his home name
was Felix. His father called him baby at first, then
son. He liked everybody, but he adored his own
father. Barbe stood a little in the background, not
that she loved him less, but she gave a continual
thanksgiving that he had met with such a warm welcome.</p>

<p>Daffodil was amused at his pretty ways, and the
cunning bits of mischief that she often kept from his
mother. She was so certain of her father's affection
now. She took a warm interest in his doings, she
sided with him about the country, and listened delightedly
to the stories of bravery and endurance, and absolutely
quarrelled with grandad when he predicted
the wretched times that would follow throwing off
the protection of the mother country, and the surety
that an appeal would be made again for her protection.</p>

<p>"An' just look at what they are saying about your
precious Washington! They'll turn him out before
he's served his four years. No two of them think
alike! And how's the money to be raised for expenses!
You silly child, you don't know anything
about it. An' your father's a gey fule!"</p>

<p>"I'll never come in this house again, grandad!"
with a dignity that made her pink cheeks red and her
blue eyes black.</p>

<p>"Then sure you'll never go out of it on such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
terms!" and grandad caught her and scrubbed her
with his stubby beard, and hugged her so tight she was
glad to promise she would come to-morrow. And
likely she ran over that very evening.</p>

<p>"He's not worth the minding," Norry would declare.
"He don't believe the half of it, and says it
to see you spurt up. He's half the time spilin' for a
quarrel that has no more in it than an empty eggshell."</p>

<p>Daffodil began to have some new interests in her
life. She was growing rapidly, she went to school,
and met children of her own age. Several chapels
had been started, and there was a real clergyman,
though they could not have him regularly, and then a
reader took the service. The men had various outdoor
diversions that had been brought from "the old
country," and were never loath to join the women's
frolics, at which there was dancing, and, it must be
admitted, not a little drinking.</p>

<p>Norah took her out occasionally, "for," she said to
Barbe, "it isn't just right to make an old woman of
her. They love the fun when they're young, and
that's natural, an' it's a sin to crowd them out of it."</p>

<p>Barbe was very domestic. Her house, her little
boy, her sewing and spinning, filled up all her time.
The child was a marvel to her. He was so bright
and active, so pretty and merry, but altogether different
from Daffodil.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span></p>

<p>Once when they had talked over great-grandfather's
bequest, Bernard had said, "It seems almost
a pity that Dilly had not been the boy, with that great
estate to come to him. A man can do so much more
in a business way than a woman. Not but that the
boy will be cared for, father's heart is set on him.
And I shall see that he is well provided for if I live."</p>

<p>Bernard Carrick was deeply interested in the welfare
and advancement of the town, and found much
work to do outside of the farm that his father-in-law
attended to, indeed, had the greater interest in.
Sandy Carrick had a great outlying tract. Grain of
all kinds, especially wheat, grew for the mere planting
in the virgin soil. And the staple product of the time
was whiskey. Nearly every farmer had a still. The
morality of drinking was not called in question, and
the better class of people were temperate. It was
the great thing they could exchange for their needs.
They sent it over the mountains to Kentucky and
Ohio. They built rough sort of tugs, and freighted
it through the Ohio to the Mississippi, disposing of it
anywhere along the route. The mouth of the great
river was still in the hands of the Spanish.</p>

<p>It must be confessed, since the birth of Felix, Barbe
had shared her motherhood a good deal with Norah,
who laid claim largely to Daffodil. They wandered
through the woods together, for the child peopled
them with the old stories that Norah's faith made so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
real. She stopped for her at school, and brought her
home to supper. Grandad at times tried to tease her.
Strangely enough she was never jealous, even of her
father's love for the little brother. And she said to
grandad:</p>

<p>"You may love him all you like. He is a boy.
Men ought to love boys. And he is named after
you, though I don't like the name."</p>

<p>"Oh, you don't! One grandfather is as good as
the other, and I'm nearer of kin. It's a good old
Scotch name, an' they're good as the French any day."</p>

<p>"I don't like Sandy."</p>

<p>"And I don't like Felix. But I put up with it.
You won't make a Frenchman out of him. I'll see to
that;" and he gave a funny wink out of his eye.</p>

<p>"And if some day he should want to go to
France?"</p>

<p>"I'll see that he doesn't. This place will be big
enough and good enough for him. There's fortunes
to be made here. I'm going to leave him mine, an'
I'll bet you a gallon of whiskey it'll be worth more
than your wild land."</p>

<p>"Well, I shan't care!" archly, and with laughing
eyes. "I like the woods and the birds and the squirrels.
Some day I'll have a house built, and I'll take
Norah to live with me."</p>

<p>"You will, hey? I'll have something to say about
that. Do you suppose I'll stay here and starve?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span></p>

<p>He tried to look very angry, but she knew all about
his face, and his tone, and said nonchalantly, "Oh,
you can go over to the other house and get something
to eat."</p>

<p>"Well, we'll see, little Miss Madam. You'll be
gravely mistook!"</p>

<p>So they jested and pretended to bicker. Then
grandad set up Norah with a pony and a sort of jaunting
car, that would only hold two. For Daffodil
could no longer keep her seat in the old fashion,
neither would her arms reach around grandad.</p>

<p>Sometimes Norah took out Barbe and the little
boy. For Daffodil went to school quite regularly
about eight months of the year. The remaining
time most of the children were needed to help at
home.</p>

<p>Any other child would have been spoiled with the
favoritism at school. The older ones helped her at
her lessons, and in those days there were no easy
kindergarten methods. They gave her tidbits of
their luncheons, they piled her little basket with fruit,
although she insisted there was so much at home.
They brought her some strange flower they had found,
they hovered about her as if there was some impelling
sweetness, some charm. She had a way of dispensing
her regard impartially, but with so tender a grace
that no one was hurt.</p>

<p>"I just wish we could go to the same school," Ned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
Langdale said in one of the Sunday rambles. He
was always on the lookout for Norah and her.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;the big boys go there."</p>

<p>"Yes. Oh, you wouldn't like it a bit. Beside,
you couldn't. And the lessons are just awful. And
the thrashings&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't. I can't hear about that;" shaking her
pretty golden head.</p>

<p>"No. Girls oughtn't. But they say it's good for
children&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"For boys. Why, are boys worse than girls?"</p>

<p>"Oh, they are not. I know some girls who are
mean, and tricky, and don't tell the truth. All girls
are not like you."</p>

<p>"Maybe it's because everybody is so good to me.
I couldn't be bad in return, you know."</p>

<p>"Oh, I just wish you were my sister, and lived with
us."</p>

<p>"Well, you see that couldn't have been. God sent
me to mother."</p>

<p>"But a fellow can wish it."</p>

<p>"It's queer, but there are a great many things wishing
doesn't bring. I suppose it's because they <i>can't</i>
happen."</p>

<p>He gave a sigh.</p>

<p>She knew how to dance now; Norah had taught
her, but it comes natural to most children, and it did
to her. She used to dance by herself, and sometimes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
whirl little brother round, to the great amusement of
her father.</p>

<p>Ned used to stray over summer evenings to hear
Mr. Carrick talk about the war, and the dangers he
had escaped. He never told the hardest side of it,
not even to Barbe.</p>

<p>There were other boys who made various errands,
and if she was not home, went over to Sandy's for
her.</p>

<p>"This thing must stop," grandad said angrily.
"What are they running after such a child as that
for? Oh, don't tell me it's some trumped-up errand.
It's just to sit and look at her as if they never saw
a girl before! She's pretty to look at, to be sure, but
she's not going to have lovers in a long time yet."</p>

<p>"Sandy, don't get your head fuddled with that kind
of nonsense. It's a heap worse than whiskey."</p>

<p>Sandy gave an indignant grunt.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />
<br />
A NEW FRIEND</h2>

<p>"Oh, here's a letter for father. Grandad brought
it. From Philadelphia. And here's a queer red
something"&mdash;and Dilly peered over it.</p>

<p>"Seal," said her mother. "And, why, it's from that
friend of great-grandfather's," studying the French
emblem. And an odd shiver ran over her, as she suddenly
studied her child.</p>

<p>Dilly laughed. "You look as if you were afraid
he wanted me, as if he was some cruel old ogre, who
might eat me up."</p>

<p>Then Barbe laughed also, and stood the letter on
the high shelf over the chimney, that she could just
reach.</p>

<p>It was from Monsieur de Ronville. He was coming
to Pittsburg on some quite important business, for
parties who had heard about the discovery of minerals,
and that a blast furnace had been started; that Pittsburg
was coming to be a point of connection with the
west and south; and he would also like to see his
ward and her possessions, that he might be able to
advise in time to come. Would Mr. Carrick be kind
enough to meet him and bespeak accommodations at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
some hotel for himself and his man, for all of which
he would be extremely obliged.</p>

<p>Bernard Carrick looked at his wife in sheer amazement.</p>

<p>"Hotel! Well, there are only two or three taverns
good enough for traders, and that ilk, who don't mind
a roystering crew, gaming, and drinking. If it was
government business, he might be taken in at the Fort.
Why, what can we do? And a man. You see, he is
used to the habits of civilized life, and we have had no
time to fall into the traces. The Lindsays are in their
new house, but I couldn't ask them to take in our
guest."</p>

<p>"And we;" Barbe hesitated, then said laughingly,
"we shall have to enlarge our borders. Sometime
the boy will want a room."</p>

<p>Bernard dropped into grandfather's chair and considered.
He had been about the world enough to
know the place would look rather rough to a person
from one of the chief cities. Somehow, they were a
little different. There were pieces of fine old furniture
that had come from France, then their ways were
rather more refined. It would be the proper thing
to take him in. And he would be here in about a
week.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bradin agreed on that point. Truth to tell,
she was anxious to see this M. de Ronville, whose
father had been her father's boyhood's companion.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, you could give him Dilly's room, and she
could go over to Norry's," she said as they were discussing
the next day what was to be done. "It is a
good thing we brought down that old bedstead, though
Dilly hated it so."</p>

<p>Dilly had outgrown her little pallet, though at first
she declared the high posts were the little brown men
grown into giants, who would carry her away. But
when grandmere exhumed some faded silk hangings
where the roses were of a creamy pink, and cupids
with wings were flying about, she was soon reconciled.
Then Grandfather Bradin had made her a chest of
drawers and two chairs that looked as though they
might have been imported.</p>

<p>"And I can fix a bed in the attic for the man, so
we will have it all running smoothly."</p>

<p>"You are a great comfort," said Bernard to his
mother-in-law.</p>

<p>The post now came every week. Even the busy
folks went to meet it for the sake of the newspapers
and the occasional letters, though those mostly went
to the Fort. Sometimes a few emigrants had joined
the train. For now there seemed to have broken
out a fever for adventure, for founding new settlements,
although in some places the Indians were still
troublesome.</p>

<p>Bernard Carrick went to meet his guest. He could
have picked him from the group at once by his decidedly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
foreign air, the French aspect. He was past
sixty, rather tall, and very erect, almost soldierly,
with a beautiful white beard, though his hair was only
half sprinkled with snow. Clear, rather soft dark
eyes, and a high-bred air that gave a grave, yet kindly,
expression to his countenance. He had his horse, as
well as his servant, who was a rather small, shrewd-eyed
Frenchman.</p>

<p>Carrick introduced himself, and welcomed his guest
cordially, explaining to him that they had not arrived
at the dignity of hotels, and that the taverns
were but poor affairs, so he would be pleased to offer
him the hospitality of his own house.</p>

<p>"Thank you," he returned. "You are the father
of my ward, I presume."</p>

<p>"Yes, she is my little girl;" with a smile.</p>

<p>"An odd sort of charge. Though I suppose it
was because I was of his country. Nations are
clannish."</p>

<p>"We shall get so mixed up that we shall hardly
be able to trace our forbears. On her mother's side
my little girl is mostly French."</p>

<p>"A little girl!" He seemed surprised.</p>

<p>"She will always be that to me. Only heaven
knows my joy and gratitude at coming home from the
long struggle, and finding her and her mother alive;
indeed, the whole household. I have had a son born
since."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes. You were in the war. You may be proud
of that. It will be an honor to hand down to your
son. But your town&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>With a vague glance around, and an expression that
was clearly not admiration.</p>

<p>"It has not had your advantages, nor your people,
and is much younger. It seems to me on the verge of
civilization."</p>

<p>Bernard Carrick laughed good humoredly.</p>

<p>"That is true," he returned. "Except for the confluence
of the rivers there seems no special advantage,
though the land is thought to be rich in minerals.
And the Fort being built here&mdash;the French planned a
long chain of them."</p>

<p>"It seems a just return to France for her indifference
to her splendid Colonies. And I have lived
long enough to see if there are no fatal mistakes
made, that this will be a grand country. From the
depths of my heart I pray for her welfare."</p>

<p>"And I fought for it," was the younger man's
proud reply.</p>

<p>De Ronville had hardly expected to see such a
house as this. The aspect was undeniably French,
heightened by the old furniture that he had been used
to in his boyhood. His room was delightful. Barbe
had taken out most of the girl's fancy touches, and
odd things her grandfather Bradin had made, and left
a grave aspect. Outside, everything was a-bloom, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
a rose climbed up a trellis at the side of the window,
shaking its nodding fragrant blossoms against
the window-pane, and, when it was open, showering
in its sweet silky leaves.</p>

<p>They made friends readily. Great-grandfather
Duvernay was the link between, and the women were
more French than of any other race. It was almost
supper time when Daffodil came in, leading her little
brother by the hand. In him again the mother's
type predominated; he was a fine, robust child, with a
fearless, upright expression, and a voice that had
none of the rougher tones of so many of the early
settlers. But Daffodil! He studied her with a
little wonder.</p>

<p>For her abundant hair had not yet shaken off its
gold, and lay in loose thick curls about her neck. Her
complexion was of that rare texture that neither sun
nor wind roughened, and all the care it had was cleanliness
and the big bonnets of those days. Her features
were quite regular, the nose straight, rather defiant,
but the beautiful mouth, full of the most tantalizing
curves, fun, laughter, sweetness, and the something
termed coquetry in older women, that is not always
experience either. She was slender and full of grace,
tall for her age, but most girls grew up quickly,
though she had not left the fairyland of childhood.</p>

<p>"I am glad to see the darling of my old friend,"
smiling as he took her soft, dimpled hand. "I have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
always thought of her as a very little girl, sitting on
the arm of her grandfather's chair&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, did he tell you that!" in her bright, eager
tone. "Yes, and we used to talk&mdash;he told me so much
about France and&mdash;it was your father&mdash;was it not?
I thought you must be quite young;" and a faint
touch of surprise passed over her face.</p>

<p>"We were both set back in memory, it seems. And
even I am getting to be quite an old man."</p>

<p>"But I like old men," she said, with charming
frankness, and a tint of color deepened in her cheek.
"They are all old except father, and the men who
come in to play games are wrinkled up, and some of
them have white hair. I've had such a lot of grandfathers,
and only one grandmother."</p>

<p>"How did you get more than two?"</p>

<p>"It was great-grandfather Duvernay," explained
Barbe, "that made the third."</p>

<p>"And this is his chair. Mother wanted to take it
away, but I could not bear to have it leave this corner.
I could see him in it. Strange how you can
see one who is not really there, or do they come back
for a moment? Here is the arm where I sat, and I
used to put my arm round his neck. I am going to
let you sit in his chair. Father won't mind;" glancing
inquiringly at her mother.</p>

<p>"Dilly, you are too forward," and Barbe colored.
Felix was climbing in her lap and almost upset her.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span></p>

<p>"No, no; her prattle is the most cordial welcome.
And I hope you will soon like me well enough to
come and sit on the arm and hear my stories."</p>

<p>"Oh, have you what Norry calls a bag of stories,
that the little brown men carry about? They're queer,
and they drop them over you while you are asleep,
and that makes dreams, and you see people, and have
good times with them."</p>

<p>M. de Ronville laughed. Bernard came in; he had
been settling the man, and the luggage, and now repeated
his hearty welcome.</p>

<p>When M. de Ronville settled himself in the corner
and the chair you could almost fancy grandfather
had come back. They had a strong likeness of race of
the higher type, those who had been pure livers and
held strongly to their religion. He was very tired
with the journey and looked pale as he sat there,
relaxed.</p>

<p>Barbe and her mother spread the table. They
had a sort of outdoor kitchen they used for cooking
in the warm weather. Felix was asking questions of
his sister, who answered them with a sort of teasing
gayety. Why was this so and that, and did she ever
see a panther. Jimmy Servy's father killed a wolf
out by the Fort, and Jimmy said a wolf would eat
you up. Would it truly? "Then when I am big
enough to fire a gun I'll go out and shoot all I can
find."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span></p>

<p>The supper was most appetizing if it did not have
the style of his own house. He was really pleased
with the simplicity of the two women, and Mr. Bradin
and his son-in-law certainly were intelligent if they
had not the range of the greater world. Daffodil was
quiet and well-mannered he observed. In truth he
was agreeably surprised with these people who were
not held in high esteem by the culture of the large
city.</p>

<p>Dilly came to him afterward.</p>

<p>"I am going over to grandad's," she announced.
"I stay all night with them sometimes. Oh, I hope
you will like Norry. I love her dearly and you
mustn't mind if grandad is a little queer."</p>

<p>"No, I will not," amused at her frankness.</p>

<p>"He is just a splendid old man!" she announced
to Norah. "And he looks like great-grandfather.
I'm going to like him ever so much, and I want
you to."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I'll like him," responded Norah readily.
"I fancied he was one of the high and mighty dukes
like that Colonel Leavitt, and I'm glad for your
mother's sake that he's comfortable to get along
with. It never would have done for him to go to
a tavern."</p>

<p>They talked a little at the other house and then
retired for the night. And the next day was a busy
one. Bernard Carrick took him about and they inspected
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
the blast furnace on which high hopes were
built, but the knowledge in those times was rather
limited. It struggled along for some years and then
better things came in its stead.</p>

<p>The river front was quite a busy place. Yes, de
Ronville admitted there was great promise of a thriving
city. And over opposite might be another. He
knew how the cities on the eastern coast had improved
and grown in power. One had only to wait. And
his ward was young. Though he wondered a little
at the faith of his friend Duvernay. But the old
man, not so old then, had in his mind the beautiful
estates in the land of his birth, and this land commanding
the river and what would sometime be a
thriving town attracted his fancy. He had hoped so
that Barbe's child would be a son, but he had loved
Daffodil with the passion of declining years. Felix
had come too late.</p>

<p>M. de Ronville found much to interest him. The
eastern shore would not be all of the country. Explorers
were sending back glowing tales of western
possibilities. Towns were springing up and this was
the key to them all. There were large tracts of fertile
lands that seemed to have been deserted by the Indians
and that were of amazing fertility. After all
Felix Duvernay had made no mistake.</p>

<p>And Daffodil found her way to the guest's heart
with very little effort. It might have been her beauty,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
that no one around seemed aware of, or her pretty,
winsome manner. She accompanied him and her
father on their rides about. She was a graceful and
well-trained horsewoman. She had so many dainty
legends of out-of-the-way nooks; most of them Norah
had grafted on old country tales.</p>

<p>And the evenings at home came to be quite a
delight for them all, listening to the glories of his
city and the strides it had made. Of the famous
men, of the many incidents in the great struggle, its
churches and various entertainments as well as the
social aspect. Daffodil listened enchanted.</p>

<p>They had come to be such friends that she sat
on the broad arm of the chair, but he noted her wonderful
delicacy in never dropping into familiarities,
while they were so common with her father, and
grandad was almost rough with her. True, Barbe
had an innate refinement and it was the child's birth-right
as well.</p>

<p>She sat there one afternoon. Mother and grandmother
were busy preserving fruit for winter use,
it grew so plentifully, but they had not mastered the
art of keeping some of the choicest through the winter
uncooked.</p>

<p>"Daffodil," he began gravely, "your parents have
entertained me most delightfully. You have a charming
home and I shall hate to leave it. But on Thursday
there is a return post and I have overstayed the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
time I thought would be ample to transact the business
I came about. And now I must return."</p>

<p>"Oh!" she exclaimed. "Oh, I do not want you
to go."</p>

<p>What pleading, beautiful eyes she raised to him.</p>

<p>Old as he was it thrilled through his pulses.</p>

<p>"But, my child, I cannot live here. And I shall miss
you so much. Why I have half a mind to run away
with you. I wonder if you would like a visit to my
beautiful city."</p>

<p>"Oh, it would be splendid! But&mdash;is there any one&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To take care of you? There is a housekeeper
and a maid, and a jolly, good-natured black woman,
who cooks in the kitchen. There are two carriages
and horses, and there will be so much to see. It is
so different from this."</p>

<p>She seemed to consider. "Yes," rather irresolutely,
"if I could go. They would miss me so much
here."</p>

<p>"And would you be homesick?"</p>

<p>"Not in a good long while, with you;" she returned
with a child's innocence. "And you would
surely let me come back?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my dear; even if it broke my heart to do it.
I wish you were my little granddaughter."</p>

<p>"Then I would have another grandfather," and
she gave a soft, musical ripple. After an instant she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
caught his hand in hers so plump and warm, and exclaimed&mdash;"Oh,
I should like to go."</p>

<p>"Dilly; Dilly!" exclaimed the fresh boyish voice;
"come and see what I have. Grandad and I have
been fishing."</p>

<p>There was a string of shining plump fish that as
Felix said still wiggled in their freshness. "Oh,
Dilly, if you only were a boy! Grandad says you are
not worth a button at fishing."</p>

<p>"They're fine, little brother. No, I don't love to
fish. And baiting!" She shuddered as she spoke.</p>

<p>"But you can eat them afterward."</p>

<p>"I couldn't if I caught them myself."</p>

<p>"I wanted a nice lot before the gentleman went
away. And Katy and Peg Boyle were out and they
are great. It was a fine afternoon for fishing I tell
you!"</p>

<p>She went through to the kitchen with him. He was
a boy for all kinds of sport, but he abhorred school
and was glad when it closed early in the summer, for
the boys and girls were needed at home. Sandy Carrick
inducted his grandson into all boyish pursuits.
His heart was bound up in Felix.</p>

<p>He began to prepare the fish for cooking. Dilly
looked out over the wide expanse where trees were
thick with leaves and laden with fruit. But she did
not truly see anything for her eyes were following
her thoughts. To go to a great and wonderful city
where they had rung the first bell for independence,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
to see the splendid houses and the ladies in fine array
and to hear beautiful music. But of course she could
not go. They would miss her so much. Yet it seemed
as if she did very little now.</p>

<p>They had not the strenuous methods of to-day. If
those old settlers of Pittsburg with their simple living
could come back they would lose their senses at the
luxury and striving for gain, the magnificence, the
continual hurry and restlessness, the whirl of business
undreamed of then. No one was striving to outshine
his neighbor. House furnishing lasted through generations.
Fashions in gowns and hats went on year
after year, and it left time for many other things.
Barbe Carrick found hours for lace-making; as was
the custom of that time she was laying by in the old
oaken chest articles and napery for the time when
Daffodil would go to a home of her own. For then
it was a great disappointment to the mother if a girl
did not marry.</p>

<p>In the old chair Gaspard de Ronville sat dreaming.
He should have married long ago and had children
and grandchildren. Would there have been one
pretty, golden-haired girl among them with a sweet
voice and such eyes as were sure to find the way to
one's heart, such rosy, laughing lips, sweet for lovers
to kiss when the time came? And then&mdash;oh, if it
could be!</p>

<p>That evening he laid his plan before the household.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
Might he take Daffodil for a few months' visit, and
thereby return their cordial hospitality that had given
him a most unexpected pleasure. She would be well
taken care of, that he could assure them. And in
event of her losing her natural protectors he as her
trustee and guardian would be only too happy to take
charge of her. He would have her best interests at
heart always. And it might be well for her to see a
little of the world. She might desire more education
than the place could afford.</p>

<p>They were all too much amazed to reply at once.</p>

<p>"Pittsburg is good enough!" flung out grandad.
"Her interests will be here. She'll marry here, she'll
die and be buried here, and she'll know enough to
get to heaven at the last without all the folderols of
a great city, as those folks think it because they rung
their bell when they cut loose from the mother country!"</p>

<p>"Oh, we couldn't spare her," said the mother.
"And, Dilly, you wouldn't want to go away among
strangers."</p>

<p>"Oh, no," returned the little girl, and she knew
then she had two sides to her nature, and one was
longing for the new and untried, and the other clung
to what was familiar. There were tears in her eyes,
but she could not have told which chord of her soul
of all the many was touched.</p>

<p>"I should just die without you!" protested Norah.
"I couldn't love a colleen of my own better."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span></p>

<p>Grandmere said but little. She saw there was
an unquiet longing in the child's heart. She could
not quite approve of trusting her to strangers, but
she knew girls had come from the old world to Virginia
and married men they had never seen before,
and made good wives and mothers. Daffodil was too
young to think of lovers, two years hence there might
be danger.</p>

<p>"I'd go!" declared Felix in his most manly fashion.
"Why, Tim Byerly has been out to Ohio, which
is a real country, not all a river. And Joe Avery
went over to the Mes'sipy and down to New Orleans."</p>

<p>"Mississippi," corrected his mother.</p>

<p>"That's what Joe calls it. And men haven't time
for such long names. Yes, I mean to go about when
I'm big and have some money. Father 'n' I'll set out
and discover some new state and take possession of it
in the name of the President. Of course girls can't
set out to discover things. And Philadelphia has
been discovered already."</p>

<p>They had not long to think about it. And as if to
make it the more possible an old neighbor, Mrs.
Craig, who was going to spend the winter in the distant
city with a married daughter, offered to give
her a mother's care on the journey. Girl friends
came in and envied her the wonderful luck. Most of
the neighbors took it for granted that she would go.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span></p>

<p>As for the little girl she changed her mind about
every hour. She had come to care a great deal about
M. de Ronville. In youth one responds so readily to
affection and he had learned to love her as he had
never loved anything in his life. He was charmed
with her frankness and simplicity, her utter unworldliness.
She seemed to care no more for the
great estate over the river than if it had been a mere
garden patch. And he thought her too lovely to be
wasted upon any of these rather rough, commonplace
young men. She must be taught to know and
appreciate her own value.</p>

<p>It was only settled the night before. There was
no need of much making ready, they could get what
she wanted in the great city. And they must allow
him the pleasure of providing for her. No one
would be wronged by whatever he might do for her.</p>

<p>Grandad had been very grumpy about it, and
Norah cried and scolded and then admitted it was
the most splendid thing, like a fairy story. Felix
was full of delight. And the good-by's were so
crowded at the last that her head was in a whirl. She
felt as if she should come back that same night and
talk over her day's journey.</p>

<p>And so the little girl went out of Pittsburg with
good wishes, and perhaps a little envy from those
who would like to have been in her place.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />
<br />
DAFFODIL'S NEW WORLD</h2>

<p>Their first stage was in the coach. There was
really quite a caravan for the weather was very
pleasant for such a trip. Mrs. Craig fussed a little
in a motherly way, and M. de Ronville watched her
attentively, fearful she might give way to tears. But
she had a stunned, incredulous feeling. Two men
in the coach were arguing about the feasibility of
Philadelphia becoming the capital of the Nation. It
should never have gone to New York, which, after
all, had been a nest of Tories.</p>

<p>One of the men recalled grandad to her mind and
she could not forbear a vague little smile. It roused
her to an amused interest and she asked M. de Ronville
in a low tone which was right.</p>

<p>"The stout man is right, but he might be less dogmatic
about it. I wondered at its going so far
North."</p>

<p>Mrs. Craig was quite chatty and a very sensible
body who saw several amusing things outside of the
coach. All the passengers had brought luncheons
along and they stopped by a wayside spring for a
refreshing drink and to water the horses. Most of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
the travellers took a little walk around to rest their
limbs. And then on again. The afternoon seemed
long to Daffodil, though M. de Ronville entertained
her with some reminiscences of the war and before
that time, and how queer and unpromising the first
beginnings were, and about William Penn, whose
dream and desire had been "A fair roomy city with
houses set in gardens of greenery," and Benjamin
Franklin, who had done so much brave work for the
country.</p>

<p>The post road had been made very tolerable. The
darkness dropped down and the woods seemed full
of strange things that made her shiver. Then they
stopped at an inn&mdash;taverns they were called in those
days&mdash;and had a good supper.</p>

<p>"Are you very tired?" asked M. de Ronville with
much solicitude.</p>

<p>"Not so much tired as stiff. I think I never sat
still so long even at school," and she smiled.</p>

<p>"It's a rather long journey, and I hope," he was
going to say, "you will not be homesick," but
checked himself and added, "that you will not get
clear tired out. I will see if we cannot get some
horses for to-morrow. That will make a change."</p>

<p>"Oh, I shall like that," her face in a glow of
pleasure.</p>

<p>The supper was very good and she was healthily
hungry. Mrs. Craig found some amusement to keep
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
up the little girl's spirits, and she fared very well
until she was safe in bed beside her kind companion.
Then she turned her face to the wall and her mind
went back to all the nights in her short life when she
had been kissed and cuddled by mother or grandmere,
or for the last ten days by Norry, and now
she suddenly realized what the separation meant.</p>

<p>The glamour was gone. She could not go back.
Oh, why had she come! She wanted to fly to the
dear ones. She wiped her eyes with the sleeve of her
nightdress, and sighed very softly, but she need not
have minded, for Mrs. Craig was gently snoring.</p>

<p>The next morning was bright and clear, but she
wondered where she was when Mrs. Craig spoke to
her. What a little bit of a room and a tin basin to
wash in!</p>

<p>"I hope you slept well. And I never dreamed a
word! What a shame, when your dreams in a strange
place come true&mdash;but you wouldn't want a bad dream
to come true."</p>

<p>"No," in a very sober tone.</p>

<p>There was noise enough, but it was not the familiar
home tones and Felix bustling about. Daffodil made
a great effort to restrain her feelings and laughed
a little at some of the sallies.</p>

<p>M. de Ronville was pacing up and down the hall,
and he held out both hands, but his eyes wore an
anxious expression.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span></p>

<p>"My dear little girl, I could not help thinking last
night that it was very selfish of me to want to take
you away from your home and those who love you
so dearly just for a bit of pleasure to myself. Did
you go to sleep thinking hard thoughts of me?"</p>

<p>She raised her lovely eyes, but the face was sweet
and grave.</p>

<p>"Oh, you know I need not have come unless I had
wanted to. I didn't think it would be so&mdash;so hard,"
and there was a little quiver in her voice.</p>

<p>"And are you sorry? Do you want to go back?"</p>

<p>"No," she answered with a certain bravery. "I
like you very much and you want to do the things
that please those you care a great deal for. And I
want to see the beautiful city and the wonderful
places where things have happened. And I am
going to be very happy, only I shall think of them all
at home."</p>

<p>"That is right. And I am going to do all I can
to make you happy. The journey will be tiresome&mdash;I
have seldom had to take any delicate person into
consideration and I didn't think&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I shall not get tired out," laughing with
some of her olden spirit.</p>

<p>He had been upbraiding himself during the night
for his covetous desire of having her a little longer.
Yes, he would have been glad if she was in reality
his ward, if she were some friendless, homeless child
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
that he could take to his heart for all time. There
were many of them who would be glad and thankful
for the shelter. But he wanted this one.</p>

<p>The riding for awhile was a pleasant change, and
they talked of themselves, of M. de Ronville's home,
one of the early old houses where he had lived for
years, alone with the servants. She had heard most
of it before, but she liked to go over it again.</p>

<p>"I wonder why you didn't marry and have children
of your own," and there was a cadence of regret
in her tone that touched him.</p>

<p>"I supposed I would. But year after year passed
by and then I grew settled in my ways, and satisfied.
I was a great reader."</p>

<p>"Oh, I wonder if I shall disturb you?" and there
is a charm in her accent that warms his heart. "You
must have seen that we live so altogether, that word
just expresses it, as if all our interests were just the
same. And they are. And I shall be&mdash;strange. Is
the housekeeper nice?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;a little formal and dignified perhaps.
Mrs. Jarvis. And she is a widow without children.
Then there is Jane, quite a young woman. Of course,
Chloe belongs to the kitchen department. And there
is a young man."</p>

<p>There is no new accession of interest. She only
says&mdash;"And is that all in a great big house?"</p>

<p>"Oh, there are visitors at times. I've had General
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
Lafayette and Count de Grasse and not a few of our
own brave men. But they have largely dispersed
now, and sometimes I have a rather lonely feeling. I
suppose I am getting old."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know how any one can live without
folks, real folks of their very own," she said with
emphasis.</p>

<p>"Yet, the friends have ties and interests elsewhere,
and you have no close claim on them. It is not a
good thing. Suppose grandfather Duvernay had been
all alone those later years."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't believe he could have lived. He was
so fond of us all. And I loved him so. But I
couldn't truly think he had gone away. I used to sit
on the arm of the chair and talk to him. Do you
know just where they go, and can't they come back
for a little while? Oh, I know mother would. She
couldn't stay away!"</p>

<p>Her eyes had a beautiful expression, almost as if
she had a vision of the other world.</p>

<p>"Oh, he was to be envied," exclaimed de Ronville,
with deep feeling. His own life looked lonelier
than ever.</p>

<p>By noon she was glad to go back to the coach. It
had changed some of its passengers and there were
two children that attracted Daffodil's interest and put
her in a still more charming light.</p>

<p>It was a long and tiresome journey with one wild
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
storm and some cloudy days, but at last they reached
the much desired city, and were driven out to the
end of Broad Street. It was still the "greene country
towne," although it had taken on city ways. This
house stood then in the midst of greenery, having a
garden on both sides, one devoted to choice fruit,
the other to flowers and a sort of kitchen garden.
It was a square brick house with green blinds,
a wide doorway, and a hall running through the
centre.</p>

<p>Mrs. Jarvis answered the summons herself.</p>

<p>"A hundred warm welcomes, my dear friend,"
she said most cordially. "We have missed you so
much. I hope you are well?"</p>

<p>"Quite worn with the journey. And this is my
ward&mdash;Miss Daffodil Carrick."</p>

<p>She held out her hand to the young girl and smiled
at the attractive face.</p>

<p>"Will you go upstairs at once? There will be
time for a rest before supper. Oh, sir, you can
hardly think how glad we are to get you back."</p>

<p>The hall and stairs seemed to Daffodil as if they
were carpeted with moss. Four rooms opened on
the upper hall. Jules had his master's portmanteau
as well as that of the girl, which he set down at
the opposite door. Mrs. Jarvis led her in.</p>

<p>"This is my room and you see there is a connecting
doorway so you need not feel lonely. You must be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
tired with the dreadful journey. How people ever
ventured before there was a post road I can't imagine.
Yet there are families going out to Ohio and Kentucky,
as if there was not land enough here to settle.
Now I'll send up Jane with some warm water that
will refresh you very much. And then you had better
take a rest. Supper is at six. You have nearly
two hours."</p>

<p>Left to herself Daffodil took a survey of the room.
It looked quite splendid to her untrained eyes with its
soft carpet, its pretty chairs, its bedstead and bureau
of light wood, its clock and tall candlesticks on the
mantel, and the dressing mirror that stood on feet and
in which you could see the whole figure. Then in a
little nook curtained off was a washing stand with
beautiful appointments in white and old blue. She
glanced around in amazement and was still standing
there when Jane entered.</p>

<p>A quaint enough figure in a short, scant frock,
short-waisted as was the fashion of the times, of
home-dyed blue linen that would have been one of
the new colors of to-day where we have gone
through every conceivable shade and hue. The
sleeves were short, but there were long-armed mitts
for summer wear. The cape was of the same material
and the straw gipsy hat had a bow on the top
and the strings to tie under the chin when it was not
too warm.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, you look as if you did not mean to stay,"
cried Jane. "Let me take your hat and cape."</p>

<p>Jane was nearer thirty than twenty, a comely, fresh-faced
girl with an air of youthfulness, attired in a
sort of Quaker gray gown, with a lace kerchief
crossed over her bosom. Her hair was banded straight
above her ears and gathered in a knot behind.</p>

<p>"Oh, miss, you look fagged out. Mrs. Jarvis said
when you'd had a good wash you must go to bed
awhile. There's nothing freshens you up like that.
It must have been an awful journey! My brother
has gone out to Ohio. Do you live anywhere near
that?"</p>

<p>"Not so very far away. And the Ohio river runs
by us."</p>

<p>"I want to know now! The world's a funny sort
of place, isn't it, Miss, with land here and water there
and great lakes up North and a gulf at the South that
they do say is part of the ocean. Now&mdash;shan't I unpack
your portmanteau?"</p>

<p>"Monsieur de Ronville wouldn't let mother pack
up much, he said things could be bought here."</p>

<p>"Yes, there's no end of them now that we are
trading openly with France."</p>

<p>"And I was growing so fast," she continued apologetically,
for the two frocks looked but a meagre
outfit. One was a delicate gingham made out of a
skirt of her mother's when gowns were fuller, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
other her best white one tucked up to the waist and
with some rare embroidery.</p>

<p>"Can I help you any?"</p>

<p>"No," returned Daffodil in a soft tone and with a
half smile. "I'm used to waiting on myself."</p>

<p>"I'll come in and fasten your frock. You'll put on
the white one;" and Jane withdrew.</p>

<p>Oh, how good the fresh water and soap scented
with rose and violet seemed! She loitered in her
bathing, it was so refreshing. Then she did throw
herself across the foot of the bed and in a few
moments was soundly asleep, never stirring until
some one said&mdash;"Miss; Miss!"</p>

<p>"Oh! I had a lovely rest. You get so jolted in a
stage coach that it seems as if your joints were all
spinning out."</p>

<p>"Oh, miss, what beautiful hair? It's just like
threads of gold. And it curls in such a lovely fashion!
And such dark lashes and eyebrows sets you
off."</p>

<p>Jane was such a fervent note of admiration that
Daffodil blushed.</p>

<p>She was very pretty in her frock that ended above
the ankles, and her fine white linen home-knit stockings
were clocked. True her shoes were rather
clumsy, but her shoulders made amends for any
shortcomings. Her skin was very fair; sometimes it
burned a little, but it never tanned.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, miss, if you had a ribbon to tie your curls
up high! All the young ladies wear it so."</p>

<p>"I'm not <i>quite</i> a young lady," archly.</p>

<p>M. de Ronville came out of the library to meet her.
The little flush and the shy way of raising her eyes
was enchanting. She seemed a part of the handsome
surroundings, really more attractive than in the plainness
of her own home.</p>

<p>"You are a most excellent traveller," he began.
"And I give you a warm and heartfelt welcome to
my house. You should have been my granddaughter.
What now?" seeing a grave look settled in her face.</p>

<p>"I was thinking. I wish I might call you uncle.
It's queer but I never had an uncle with all the other
relations. They seem to run in one line," and she
laughed.</p>

<p>"Oh, if you will. I've wished there was some way
of bringing us nearer together. Yes, you shall be
my niece. You won't forget?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no; I am so glad." She seemed to come a
little closer, and he placed his arm around her. Oh
why did he never know before how sweet love could
be! Then he kisses down amid the golden hair.
Even her cheek is sacred to him and her lips must be
kept for some lover.</p>

<p>There was a little musical string of bells that summoned
them to supper. A young man of three- or
four-and-twenty stood just inside the door.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span></p>

<p>"For convenience sake Miss Carrick will be announced
as my niece as she is my ward. Allow me to
present Mr. Bartram."</p>

<p>Daffodil flushed and bowed. M. de Ronville placed
her chair for her. The table was round and very
beautifully appointed. She and the young man were
opposite. He was rather tall, well looking without
being especially handsome. Mrs. Jarvis poured the
tea. The two men talked a little business.</p>

<p>"I shall lay the matter before the Wetherills to-morrow,"
de Ronville said. "I was surprised at
the promise of the place and it has a most excellent
location. At present it is rather wild, but after seething
and settling down the real town comes to the
surface. It will not be a bad investment if one can
wait. And the Wetherills are not likely to lack descendants.</p>

<p>"I am glad you were not disappointed," returned
the young man.</p>

<p>"We know so little about Pittsburg," said Mrs.
Jarvis, "except the great defeat of Braddock in the
old war. Your people are French, I believe," turning
to Daffodil.</p>

<p>"Yes, on the one side. The town seems to be
made up of all nations, but they agree pretty well.
And they have many queer ways and fashions."</p>

<p>Daffodil did not feel as strange as she had been
fearing for the last two or three days that she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
would. Mother and grandmere would stand a comparison
with Mrs. Jarvis, who had the dignity and
bearing of a lady.</p>

<p>Some friends came in to congratulate M. de Ronville
on his safe return. Mrs. Jarvis was much relieved
at Daffodil's quiet manner. And she certainly
was a pretty girl. They had quite a little talk by
themselves when the guests were gone and Mrs.
Jarvis was well pleased that she had come of a good
family, as the town set much store by grandfathers
and the French were in high repute.</p>

<p>Before M. de Ronville went to business the next
morning he made a call on Miss Betty Wharton, who
was a person of consequence and had had a romance,
a lover who had been lost at sea when he was coming
to marry her and the wedding finery was all in order.
She and her mother lived together, then the mother
died and Betty went on in her small house with a
man and a maid and a negro cook. They were in
high favor at that time. She had been quite a belle
and even now was in with the Franks and the Shippens
and the Henrys, and through the war her house
had been quite a rendezvous for the patriots. She
was an excellent card player, good humored and full
of spirits, helpful in many society ways. She could
have married, that all her friends knew; indeed two
or three elderly beaux were still dangling after her.</p>

<p>"I am come to ask a favor," he said after the talk
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
of his journey was over. "I have brought back
with me a young girl, my ward, who will some day
have a big and valuable estate as the country improves.
Mrs. Jarvis hardly feels capable of shopping
for her, and of course does not go about much. She
is a charming girl and my father and her great-grandfather
were the dearest of friends. M. Duvernay
almost rounded out his hundred years. I call her
my niece as the French blood makes us kin. Could
you oblige me by taking her in hand, seeing that she
has the proper attire and showing her through the
paths of pleasure? You will find her a beautiful and
attractive young girl."</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;really!" and her tone as well as her smile
bespoke amusement. "French! Where did you unearth
this paragon? And is she to have a lover and
be married off? Has she a fortune or is she to look
for one?"</p>

<p>He would not yield to annoyance at the bantering
tone.</p>

<p>"Why, she is a mere child, and has no thought of
lovers. She will have fortune enough if times go
well with us, and need not think of that until her
time of loving comes. She has been brought up very
simply. There is a brother much younger. Her
father was in the war the last three years. She is not
ignorant nor unrefined, though Pittsburg does not
aim at intellectuality."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span></p>

<p>"Pittsburg! Isn't it a sort of Indian settlement,
and&mdash;well I really do not know much about it except
that it is on the western borders."</p>

<p>"Oh, it is being civilized like all new places. We
have had to work and struggle to plant towns and
bring them into shape. Pittsburg has a most admirable
position for traffic and abounds in iron ore
as well as other minerals."</p>

<p>"And the girl <i>is</i> presentable?"</p>

<p>"Oh, she is not old enough for society. I did not
mean that. But to go about a little and perhaps to a
play, and places where it would look odd for me to
take her without some womenkind. We French have
rather strict ideas about our girls. Come to supper
to-night and see her."</p>

<p>"Why, I'll come gladly. I like your young man,
too. He has not been spoiled by the flirting young
women. It is a shame I did not marry and have such
a son to lean on in my old age;" and she laughed
gayly.</p>

<p>"Then you can see for yourself. And if you do
not like Miss Carrick we will let the matter drop
through."</p>

<p>"Yes, I will be happy to come."</p>

<p>M. de Ronville went on to his office. Already there
began to be business streets in the Quaker City that
was rapidly losing its plainer appearance. This was
rather old-fashioned and wore a quiet aspect. One
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
clerk sat on a high stool transcribing a lengthy deed,
and young Bartram had just deposited another pile
of letters on his employer's desk which was at the
far end of the place and could be shut off.</p>

<p>"I think these are not worth your first consideration,"
he said in a quiet tone. "And here is a list of
people anxious to see you to-day. And&mdash;if you can
spare me a little while&mdash;I am due at the Surrogate's
office."</p>

<p>"Yes," nodding politely. Then he watched the
young man as he walked away with a light, firm
tread. There had always been a certain manliness in
Aldis Bartram since the time he had attracted his
employer's favor and been taken in as a clerk. Then
he had an invalid mother to whom he had been devoted,
that had been another passport to the elder's
favor. On her death M. de Ronville had offered him
a home and he was now confidential clerk and might
one day be taken in the business which had been made
a most excellent one from the Frenchman's uprightness
and probity as well as his knowledge and judgment.
Many a time he had settled a dispute and
made friends between two hot-headed litigants.</p>

<p>He did not read his letters at first but dropped
into a peculiar train of thought. He was in good
health and vigor, his mind was clear and alert. But
he was growing old. And if Betty Wharton in the
prime of a delightful life thought a son would conduce
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
to the pleasure and security of her old age, why
not to his? Could he have a better son than Aldis
Bartram? But he wanted the feminine contingent
and he was past marrying. He wanted some one
young and bright, and, yes, charming to look at, tender
of heart. And here were these two in the very
blossom time of life. Why they might fancy each
other and in the course of time have it ripen to a
real and lasting regard. Oh, the old house would be
a Paradise. And if there were children&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>He had to rouse himself from the dream with an
effort and look over the accumulation. For perhaps
the first time business seemed irksome to him, and
he had always been fond of it, too fond perhaps.</p>

<p>Men nearly always went home to a noon dinner.
He found Mrs. Jarvis and Daffodil in a comfortable
state of friendliness, but the girl's eyes lighted with
pleasure at the sight of him and her voice was full
of gay gladness. No, she was not homesick; she
had been in the garden and there were so many
flowers she had never seen before and the ripe luscious
fruit. There had been so many things to look
at that she had not finished her letter, but she would
do that this afternoon.</p>

<p>She is a gleam of the most enchanting sunshine in
the old house, and her voice soft and merry, the
tiredness and discomfort of travelling gone out of it
is sweetest music to him and warms his heart. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
eyes are very blue to-day, not so much brilliant as
gladsome and her rosy lips curve and smile and
dimple and every change seems more fascinating than
the previous one. There is no young man in the
room, it is the outcome of her own delightful golden
heart. Oh, any young man might fall in love on the
spot.</p>

<p>"Miss Wharton will be in to supper," M. de Ronville
remarked casually. "She is not a young girl,"
seeing the look of interest in Daffodil's face; "but
you will find her a very agreeable companion."</p>

<p>"It's queer, but I don't know many young girls.
Some of the older ones were married in the spring,
and I have been so much with mother and grandmere
and Norah that I'm a little girl, a big little
girl, I've grown so much."</p>

<p>Her laugh was a gay ripple of sound. He took
it with him to the office and her golden head seemed
dancing about everywhere, just as it had at home.</p>

<p>"Of course," Miss Wharton said to herself as she
lifted the brass knocker, "de Ronville never could
be so foolish as to fall in love with a chit of a thing,
though I have heard of men training a young girl
just to their fancy. He has always been so discreet
and punctilious. French <i>are</i> a little different."</p>

<p>No, he had not overpraised her beauty. Betty
Wharton admitted that at once. And her manners
had a natural grace, it ran in the French blood.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
Why it would be a pleasure to take her about and
have men stare at her as they would be sure to do.</p>

<p>She and Mrs. Jarvis found enough to talk about,
and while the housekeeper had gone to look after
the tea she turned her attention to Daffodil.</p>

<p>"Oh, I can't help liking the place," the child said
with charming eagerness. "Mrs. Jarvis has been telling
me about the stores and the gardens a dozen
times prettier than this, though I don't see how that
can be. They don't seem to care much about gardens
at home, they have a few posy beds, but you
can go out and gather basketsful in the woods, only
they are not grand like these. And there are no such
beautiful houses. Oh, there are lots of log huts,
really, the older ones, and people are not&mdash;I don't
just know what to call it, but they do not seem to
care."</p>

<p>"All towns improve after a while. The people in
New York think they are much finer than we, and
then there is Boston&mdash;where the people are starched
so stiff with the essence of fine breeding that they
can hardly curtsey to one another. I like my town
the best, having seen them all."</p>

<p>"Oh, how splendid it must be to go about to
strange, beautiful places," the child said wistfully,
with glowing eyes.</p>

<p>"But I have not been to France;" laughingly.</p>

<p>"Neither have I. But great-grandfather came
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
from there when he was a young man. And he had
been to Paris, but he did not live there. And he and
grandmother, whom I never saw, had to fly for their
lives because they worshipped God in a different
fashion from Royalty. And I can talk quite a good
deal in French, but I like English better. It seems
to mean more."</p>

<p>Miss Wharton laughed at that.</p>

<p>They had a very delightful meal and Betty, by a
well known society art, brought out the brightness of
the little girl, that made her very charming without
any overboldness.</p>

<p>"Why you have unearthed quite a prize," Miss
Wharton said to her host later in the evening. "Has
Pittsburg many such girls? If so I am afraid our
young men will be running after them. You may
command me for any service, only I must have her
as my guest now and then."</p>

<p>"A thousand thanks. Will you see about her
wardrobe to-morrow? There is no need to stint."</p>

<p>"I shall be very glad to oblige you. I suppose
you do not mean to turn her into a young lady?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;o," rather hesitatingly.</p>

<p>"Then it shall be simple prettiness."</p>

<p>After that Miss Wharton played on the spinet and
sang several old songs. Daffodil wished grandad
could hear two that were his favorites, and she
was quite sure Norry could not have resisted jumping
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
up and dancing at the sound of "The Campbells
Are Coming." Mr. Bartram turned over the leaves
of the music, while Daffodil snuggled in the corner
of the sofa beside her guardian. And when she went
to bed her head was full of Norah's fairy stories
come true.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />
<br />
IN SILK ATTIRE</h2>

<p>The shopping the next day was something wonderful.
Daffodil was quite sure the fairies must have
had a hand in it. And such beautiful things, she
fairly held her breath over them.</p>

<p>"But, madam, when am I to wear these lovely
garments? For mother says I grow so fast, and there
is no one to take them afterward."</p>

<p>Betty Wharton laughed many times at the fascinating
simplicity of the child.</p>

<p>Then she took her to the mantua-makers, where
she was measured, and where she hardly understood
a word of what they were saying, but between whiles
played with a beautiful yellow cat, who sat on a
silken cushion and purred his delight at the touch of
the gentle hands.</p>

<p>"Now, you are to come home to dinner with me."</p>

<p>"Did uncle say I might? For mother told me to
do nothing without his permission."</p>

<p>"Oh, you darling infant!" She squeezed the slim
little body that, after all, was plump enough. It was
shocking for a young person to be fat in those days.</p>

<p>"I will make it all right with him."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Wharton's house was much smaller. A square
sort of hall, with oddly pretty furnishing, a parlor
and a dining-room off it, and all were filled with curiosities
that were family heirlooms, beautiful things,
for Miss Wharton abhorred ugliness and despised
horrid Chinese idols. The dinner was very dainty,
and Daffodil wondered how she could feel so much at
home.</p>

<p>"And to-morrow we will go out again, but we will
drive around, and you shall see the city. What means
that sober look?"</p>

<p>"Oh, madam, I shall feel so spoiled with beauty,
that I don't know how I shall content myself to go
back to Pittsburg;" and her eyes swam in a soft lustre
that was almost tears.</p>

<p>"Perhaps we shall not let you go back;" laughingly.</p>

<p>Jane came around for her in the afternoon, and she
said, "We missed you so much at dinner time. And
ever so many bundles have come for you."</p>

<p>"And I've been so full of pleasure, that any more
would run over. Oh, madam, how can I thank you!"</p>

<p>"By coming again. I'll call for you to-morrow."</p>

<p>They walked home, past pretty gardens all a-bloom
with summer richness. Daffodil was so full of delight
she wanted to dance. In her room was one
large box&mdash;that was the new hat. A rather fancy
straw, and she had not seen it trimmed. It had a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
wreath of fine roses inside, and larger ones on the
outside, and beautiful wide strings of some gauzy
stuff, that in warm weather were to float around,
but in a high wind they were tied under the chin.</p>

<p>And there was a dainty pair of red slippers, laced
across the top, with a red cord fastened diamond-wise,
and a pair of black shoes. They were not "boots"
then. These came up almost to the ankles, and were
laced across with ribbon and tied in a bow. There
were some imported stockings, but Mrs. Jarvis declared
she had never seen such pretty home-knit ones
as the little girl wore, that looked quite as if they were
of silk, and the clocks were perfect.</p>

<p>In another package was a beautiful scarf, with
threads of gold in the border, and some fine handkerchiefs.</p>

<p>"Mother has some at home, two that have wide
borders of beautiful lace, that she made herself. And
bibs that you wear over the neck of your frocks.
And she is making a lovely skirt for me, that is lace
and needlework, and I am to have it when I am quite
grown up and go out to tea."</p>

<p>Barbe Carrick had begun to think of her daughter's
marriage, and as there was but little ready money,
outfits were made at home, and packed away against
the time. For most mothers counted on it, even
thought of grandchildren.</p>

<p>Daffodil had enough to talk about that evening.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
Mr. Bartram went out, and for an hour Dilly had her
guardian quite to herself. Then two gentlemen came
in, and the tired little girl went to bed.</p>

<p>About ten the next morning a pony chaise stopped
at the door. Jules came out and took the reins, and
Miss Wharton stepped lightly down and was greeted
by Mrs. Jarvis.</p>

<p>"I have come for the little girl," she said, "having
her guardian's permission. I am going to show her
the sights, and make her sick of Pittsburg. We want
her here. Why, I never supposed I had such a
motherly streak in my nature, or I would have wedded
and had a houseful. Or else the child has some
bewitchment about her. Jane, put on her new hat
and the scarf. The frocks will be here in a day or
two."</p>

<p>Daffodil did look bewitching as she stepped into the
chaise. Miss Wharton was quite used to driving.
They went along Chestnut Street first, past the stores,
then looked at some of the old places that were to
be historical. Mistress Betty told over many of the
war adventures and the coming of the good news.</p>

<p>"And I remember that," said Daffodil. "Grandad
was angry about it. He still believes England will
get us back sometime."</p>

<p>"Yet your father went to war. How did he take
that?"</p>

<p>"I was so little then. I think I didn't know much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
about him until we heard he would come home. Then
I really began to remember. I didn't like him so
much at first, and I went to great-grandfather for
comfort. Oh, madam, he was so sweet and dear.
And when M. de Ronville came, and I put him in the
old chair, it seemed almost as if grandfather had come
back. And I liked him at once. Now he is to be my
uncle, we have settled that."</p>

<p>Then they went out on the beautiful road, where
the Shippens and several of the old families had their
capacious estates, and their large old mansions. Oh,
how lovely and orderly everything looked, the picture
of peace and plenty.</p>

<p>"Some day we will go over to Valley Forge. But
it is nearing noon, and I must not starve you. I know
of a nice place, where ladies often go at noon, and
you do not need to have a man tagging after you.
Start up, Dolly!" to the pony.</p>

<p>They came back to busy streets. There were
Quakers at Pittsburg, but they did not seem so pronounced
as here. And there were such fine-looking
men, in their drab suits, widebrimmed hats, and they
wore knee-breeches and silk stockings, quite like the
world's people. Here and there one nodded to Miss
Wharton. The elegance and harmony appealed to the
child, without her understanding why.</p>

<p>They paused at a house set back a little from the
street, with a courtyard of blooming flowers. There
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
was a wide covered porch and a trellis work wreathed
with vines. A wide door opened into a spacious hall.</p>

<p>A young colored boy came out to them.</p>

<p>"Pomp," Miss Wharton said, "take the pony and
give him a little feed and water, not too much, mind
now. He wants a little rest, so do we."</p>

<p>Pompey assisted them out with a flourish, and led
the pony up a side way. They walked to the porch,
raised by three steps, and Miss Wharton was greeted
warmly by several parties.</p>

<p>"Here is a table," said Mrs. Mason. "My dear
creature, I haven't seen you in an age. Have you
been getting married, and is this <i>his</i> daughter? Did
you take him for the sake of the child?"</p>

<p>"Alas! I have not been so fortunate! The child
has both parents. And she has just come from Pittsburg.
You know, M. de Ronville went out there and
brought back&mdash;well, it is his grandniece, I suppose&mdash;Miss
Daffodil Carrick."</p>

<p>The waiter, another colored servant&mdash;they were
quite favorites in the city for their obsequious politeness&mdash;placed
chairs for them.</p>

<p>"Pittsburg! Why, that's way at the West in the
Indian countries, on the way to Ohio, I believe. What
a long journey. And how is M. de Ronville?"</p>

<p>"Rather improved by his journey, I think. Now,
Daffodil, what will you have? You ought to be
hungry."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span></p>

<p>"You choose for me, madam;" in a low tone, and
with a tint of exquisite coloring.</p>

<p>It kept wavering over the sweet face, for she felt
somehow that she was being observed. She wished
she had on one of the pretty frocks, but Jane had
ironed out this white one, and Mrs. Jarvis had found
her a sash. But she was not accustomed to much
consideration of herself, and she was hungry. The
ladies were prettily dressed, some of them in rather
quakerish colors and they had beautiful fans and
parasols. It was quite a meeting-place, where they
exchanged bits of news, a little gossip, and had most
excellent tea.</p>

<p>"Carrick isn't a French name," said Madam Neville,
rather critically.</p>

<p>"No. She is French on the mother's side. M. de
Ronville's father and her grandfather were Huguenot
exiles in the old times. He is her guardian now, and
there is some property, enough for a town, I believe.
And you know the French once had possession of
most of that country."</p>

<p>Betty Wharton knew that would settle her status
at once, more decisively than her beauty.</p>

<p>Then some other ladies, having finished their tea,
came over for a little chat. Had she been to see
the new play? For "The Academy of Polite
Science" seemed rather above an ordinary theatre,
and Philadelphia had swung back to amusements.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
Was she going to Mrs. Chew's card party this evening?</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. She wouldn't miss it for anything."</p>

<p>"What a beautiful child!" whispered another.
"Will she live here in town?"</p>

<p>"Oh, she is only on a visit now."</p>

<p>"She's too nice to be wasted on such an outlandish
place as Pittsburg, where they do nothing but make
whiskey."</p>

<p>The pony came round, and the ladies said their
good-bys. Since the closing of the war, indeed, in
gratitude for French assistance, much honor had been
paid to our noble allies.</p>

<p>That evening M. de Ronville went to his card club.
But Daffodil had Mrs. Jarvis for audience, and in return
heard many wonderful things about the great
city.</p>

<p>If Daffodil had not been so utterly simple-hearted
and had so little self-consciousness, it might have
proved a rather dangerous ordeal for her. In a few
days she certainly was the light of the house. Even
Mr. Bartram yielded to her charm, though he fancied
girls of that age were seldom interesting: either painfully
shy, or overbold. She was neither. She seemed
to radiate a pervasive atmosphere of happiness, her
smile was so full of light and joy; and her sweet voice
touched the springs of one's heart.</p>

<p>M. de Ronville had never met with any such experience.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
A shy young man, he had kept much to his
own compatriots. Then he had devoted himself to
business, with a vague idea that when he had made
a fortune he would go back to France, that had grown
much more liberal in matters of religion. But he
had become warmly interested in the new country,
and especially the city.</p>

<p>He had been pleased with the household at Pittsburg,
the plain sensible soldier, who was making an
excellent citizen, but the two ladies he found most interesting.
It was golden-crowned Daffodil that stirred
his heart in a new fashion, and made him feel how
much had been lost out of his life. And now he had
her. A sweet, dazzling, bird-like creature, that gave
the house an altogether new aspect.</p>

<p>She went with Jane to call on Mrs. Craig. The
daughter was well married, and had four small children,
though their house was rather simple.</p>

<p>"And have you cried yourself to sleep with homesickness?"
asked Mrs. Craig. "I've heard it is
rather quiet in the big house where you are, with
only a few grown people. True, Mr. de Ronville
is like a father or, perhaps, a grandfather
would be nearer, and you have been used to elderly
men."</p>

<p>"Oh, madam, it is delightful. I like him so much.
I did at home, or I never could have come. And Mrs.
Jarvis is nice and pleasant, and tells me what is good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
manners for little girls, and Jane spoils me by waiting
on me."</p>

<p>"Madam, indeed!" laughed Mrs. Craig. "Why,
you make me feel as if I belonged to the quality!"</p>

<p>"They call the grown-up ladies that, the elder ones
I mean. And there is one who has been so good to
me, Miss Wharton, who bought my new clothes, and
tells me what to wear, and things to say that are the
fashion here. I think we have not much fashion at
home. She takes me out, and, oh, there are so many
things to see. And now uncle has hired a pony, and
I ride with him in the morning, and we all went to a
play, where the people made believe they were part of
a story, and I was charmed, for it seemed so real.
And there was a fine concert, I never heard so many
instruments. And going to church is quite grand. I
wish we had a lovely church at home. Oh, I hardly
have a moment, but I do think of them all, and how
wild Felix will be over all I shall have to tell him."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you won't want to go back."</p>

<p>"Not go back to mother and all the others? Why,
every day makes it one day nearer;" and the lovely
light in her face showed she was not forgetting them.</p>

<p>"I am going before real cold weather. It would
be too hard a journey to take in winter. But I find
it very pleasant, too."</p>

<p>"And the stores are so full of beautiful things.
People must be very rich, they spend so much money."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span></p>

<p>"It is a big town, and there are many people."</p>

<p>"And one can't help being joyous and happy."
She looked as if she could dance or fly. "And uncle
likes me best to be gay, and I should be ungrateful to
mope when so much is being done for me."</p>

<p>"Yes, that is true."</p>

<p>"And next week Miss Wharton is going to take me
to a grand out-of-door party of young people. Mrs.
Pemberton came and gave uncle the invitation for
me, and he has promised to come in the evening to
see us, and to fetch me home."</p>

<p>"Oh, but they're on the Schuylkill! Well, you are
going among the quality. You'll never do for Pittsburg
again."</p>

<p>"But I shall do for father and mother, and I shall
have such fun hearing grandad scold about all the
doings, and say that I am spoiled, and not worth a
pewter platter. And then he will hug me so tightly
that it will almost squeeze the breath out of me."</p>

<p>She laughed so merrily and her face was in a glow
of mirth and mischief. Then Jane came for her,
though she was quick about learning the city streets.
But M. de Ronville thought her too precious to be
trusted out alone, though now the town was safe
enough.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX<br />
<br />
WITH THE EYES OF YOUTH</h2>

<p>The place was like a picture by some fine artist, and
the midsummer coloring, the shade of the tall trees,
the great beds of flowers made it lovely, indeed.
There was a space of greensward that ran down
to the river, then a series of steps up the terrace,
where a large level lawn with another row of steps
led and a wide porch, with fluted columns. The house
was large, and hospitable of aspect. Now it was
filled with graceful figures, flitting to and fro, of all
ages, it seemed. For it was quite a notable occasion.</p>

<p>There were two Pemberton sons, one married; then
Miss Bessy, who was eighteen; Mary of sixteen, and
Belinda, a growing girl, whose birthday was the same
as Bessy's, though there was five years between them.
This is why young people are asked to the birthday
party. And the mothers of the girls, the brothers,
and other young men. The tables will be set out on
the lawn, three of them.</p>

<p>Bessy was to be married early in the autumn, and
lovers in those days were in no wise abashed by their
engagement. Mr. Morris hovered about his betrothed,
young Mr. and Mrs. Pemberton had not outlived
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
their honeymoon. There were other engaged
couples, and quite a merry crowd of children.</p>

<p>Betty Wharton glanced over the group, as they
ascended the steps. Not a girl was as handsome as
her <i>prot√©g√©e</i>. They had come in a coach, and the
child had just a light scarf thrown over her shoulders.
Her frock was of some white crapy stuff, the
bodice cut square in the neck after the fashion of the
day, and edged with a bit of lace; the short waist defined
with a soft blue silk sash. Her curls were
caught up high on her head, with a blue bow, and
every movement seemed to shake off a shower of
gold. Where the chin melted in her neck, and the
neck sloped to her shoulder, there were exquisite
lines.</p>

<p>"That's the little girl from Pittsburg," exclaimed
Anton Wetherell. "I didn't suppose they could raise
anything like that. She's not so little, either; why,
she must be well on to fifteen. Some connection of
that old French lawyer, de Ronville. I wonder if he
means to make her his heir? I fancy there's a good
deal of money."</p>

<p>"Miss Wharton has been making much of her, it
seems, and she isn't the one to fall into a mistake."</p>

<p>The elder ladies greeted her cordially. There was
such a charming simplicity about her and her enjoyment
of everything was infectious. She gravitated
to the younger girls, and Belinda was really fascinated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
with her. They played some games, and she was so
ready to assent to what they proposed, so frank to
admit her ignorance of some things, that they were
all ready to help her and explain. Presently they sat
on the grass in a little ring, and asked her about Pittsburg.
Was it a great city?</p>

<p>"Oh, you would think it very queer," she said
laughingly. "Only the rivers are beautiful, and the
hills, and the woods over opposite. But the people"&mdash;then
she flushed a little, but she was too honest to
embellish&mdash;"well, they are Scotch, and Irish, and
English, and a few from the East, but now those folks
are going out to Ohio. And&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But you're French," said one of the girls.
"Though I thought all French people were dark."</p>

<p>"Mother and grandmere have beautiful dark eyes
and hair. So has my little brother Felix. But my
father has blue eyes, and I don't know where the
yellow hair came from. That was why my mother
called me Daffodil."</p>

<p>"What an odd, pretty name. And your hair is
beautiful, like silk. Does it curl that way without&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>For little girls and big ones, too, had their hair
put up in curl papers, or the hairdresser used
tongs.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, it curls naturally, and tangles, too. When
I was little I wanted it cut off, there were such awful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
pulls. But mother wouldn't, because father was
away soldiering, and when he came home he wouldn't
hear to it. One grandfather used to call me Yellowtop."</p>

<p>The nearest girl was petting one of the soft, silky
curls. Another said, "Can you talk French? I'm
studying it at school. It's awful hard and queer."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. You see, I learned to talk in both languages.
Then I had a lovely great-grandfather, who
lived to be almost a hundred, and he taught me to
read quite well. There are some French Acadians,
who come in to see us now and then. But their speech
has been mixed up so much. I've been reading a little
with uncle. After grandfather died, I almost forgot."</p>

<p>"And are there fine stores and churches, and do
you have plays, and entertainments, and parties?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no. It's queer and plain, quite rough, though
now they are making nice streets, and people are
spinning and weaving. Some of the women make
beautiful lace. There's always a May party and a
dance; and then a time when the new year begins, and
tea drinkings, and some birthdays are kept. No, you
wouldn't like it, after such a beautiful city."</p>

<p>"Oh, you won't want to go back!"</p>

<p>"Mother and all my people are there," she answered
simply. "But if I had always lived in a beautiful
city like this, I wouldn't want to."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span></p>

<p>By this time the tables were arranged, and they
were summoned to the repast. Several young lads
had joined the company, and Mary took the head of
the children's table. The lawn was a picturesque
sight. Afterward some lanterns were strung about,
but it was clear and moonlight, which added to the
beauty of the scene, and presently dancing began.
There was much rambling around.</p>

<p>Miss Wharton found her, and asked if she was
having a good time. She had been dancing with two
of the boys. "And Mr. Wetherell wants the pleasure
of dancing with the young lady from Pittsburg;"
laughing.</p>

<p>"But I am not a real young lady. And I don't
know all the dances;" in a hesitating tone.</p>

<p>"You do it at your own risk, Anton," Betty said to
the young man. "You have been warned."</p>

<p>"I'll take the risk."</p>

<p>He piloted her through very skilfully. Then
young Mr. Pemberton asked her. She met Mr.
Bartram in this quadrille, and he talked to her afterward.
She wished he would ask her to dance, but
he seemed very much occupied with the older girls.
And presently she spied out uncle de Ronville, and
went over to the step of the porch, where he was sitting
in a chair. He felt very proud of her. She
was so full of enjoyment she fairly bubbled over with
delight, as she detailed the pleasures.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span></p>

<p>"And we must be thinking of going home. That
is one of the penalties of old age."</p>

<p>"Oh," with a kind of <i>riant</i> sweetness in her voice,
"if you could go back halfway, and I could come on
halfway, wouldn't it be delightful! But I get sleepy
often in the evening, not like to-night;" as an afterthought.
"I suppose that comes of living in a country
place, where people go to bed at nine! But you
sometimes go to bed quite late."</p>

<p>Yes, if they could meet halfway! Oh, what a foolish
old man!</p>

<p>It has been a delightful evening, and Miss Wharton
joins them. "Daffodil, you have had honors
enough to turn your head. M. de Ronville, are we
spoiling her?"</p>

<p>He gave her a fatherly look, and taking her soft
little hand in his, they rose together.</p>

<p>"Will you go home in our coach?" he asked of
Miss Wharton.</p>

<p>"Very glad, indeed, my dear sir, I am rather tired.
Our party began early."</p>

<p>There were a good many adieus to make, and
some very flattering invitations for Daffodil. They
put Mistress Betty down at her own door, and when
they reached home M. de Ronville gave her a tender
good-night.</p>

<p>"It was splendid, Jane," she said as the finery was
being removed. "And I danced with several of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
young men. I didn't quite know how, but I thought
of Norry's stories about the fairy dances in the moonlight,
and I guess the real moonlight helped."</p>

<p>"I don't believe there was as pretty a girl among
them all," declared Jane admiringly.</p>

<p>It was late when Mr. Bartram came in, and he had
enjoyed himself as well.</p>

<p>But it was not all dissipation. There were evenings
when Daffodil read French to her host, and he
corrected any faulty pronunciation. At other times
it was the newspaper. She had such a clear young
voice, and she did everything with such charming
cheerfulness. The rides with him in the morning
were a delight. And though her figure had not
rounded out, there was something exquisite in the
virginal lines. She did not realize herself that she
was a big girl now, so gradual was the change, and
she had been a little girl all her life to those at home.
He thought it was the French blood, as he could recall
the girls of his youth, with their pretty deference,
but it is the little admixture of Irish that makes her
so winsome and frank.</p>

<p>Yet there were times when Daffodil was surprised
at herself, and the strange feelings and stronger emotions
that would flash across her. Was it the wider
life, the variety of people and incident, the deeper
and more comprehensive tone of the talk, and the new
pleasures of the higher type?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span></p>

<p>There was no special dividing line in those days.
Little girls wore ankle-length frocks, so the tucks
were let out as they grew taller. After a little the
hair was put up high with a pretty comb discarded
by an older sister. When she had a lover, the next
younger girl came to the fore.</p>

<p>"If the child was two years older I might make
an excellent match for her," thought Betty Wharton.
"But she isn't thinking about lovers or admiration.
She will be very lovely presently, when she knows
how to use those heart-breaking eyes and that dangerous
smile. When she comes again&mdash;of course, it
would be a sin to bury such a girl alive in that dozy,
drowsy old Pittsburg!"</p>

<p>The days flew by so rapidly. Letters did not come
frequently, postage was high, and there was a sort of
secret faith in most people that things were going
on well, according to the old adage that "no news
was good news." But when a rare letter came, she
cried over it secretly for two or three days, and was
rather grave, but she thought it ungracious not to be
bright and happy when so much was being done for
her. Mrs. Craig was planning to go before the
autumnal rains set in, and she took it for granted that
it was her place to return Daffodil.</p>

<p>The child had been talking this over one afternoon,
and a flood of home love had overwhelmed her.
Mrs. Jarvis had an old friend to supper and to spend
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
the evening, Jane had gone out, and M. de Ronville
had gone to a sort of sociable dinner, with some of
the citizens who were interested in the library project.
It had proved a rather lonesome evening, and she had
really longed for home. She wandered about aimlessly,
and presently settled herself in the corner of
the vine-covered porch, and yielded to the beauty and
fragrance of the night. Everything had a richer
aspect and meaning to her. It was moonlight again.
The tall trees seemed outlined in silver, and the flower-beds
were transformed into fairy haunts. Only a
few stars were out, they were larger and more golden
than usual. She drank in the honeyed fragrance all
about her, and it seemed a land of enchantment.</p>

<p>Some one came into the library, but did not make a
light. She heard M. de Ronville's low, but clear-toned,
voice.</p>

<p>"I have wanted to talk this matter over with you.
There need be no hurry, one or two years here will
answer. You see, I am getting to be an old man.
Latterly I have come to long for some one of my own,
that I could go down the valley of life with, and who
would care to make the journey more cheerful. You
have been almost like a son to me. I should like you
to be that, indeed. And this child has grown very
dear to me. To think of you both going on here
in the old house when I have left it, would give me my
heart's desire. She is lovely, she is sweet, and has a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
most admirable temper. Then those people are in
comfortable circumstances, and of the better class.
You know it is a trait of our nation to be deeply interested
in the marriage of our children, to advise,
often to choose for them, with our wider experience."</p>

<p>"But she is such a child, eager, unformed, and I
have thought of some one, companionable, with a
wider education&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>That was Mr. Bartram's voice.</p>

<p>"We can remedy all that. I could have her here,
and I think she is an apt scholar. She is well up in
French, and that is quite in demand now. She could
be trained in music, she has a sweet voice. And she
is very graceful. If you could see the indifferent
manners of most people in that queer, backward town,
you would wonder at her refinement, her nice adjustment.
Her mother, the Duvernay people, are high-bred,
yet in no wise pretentious."</p>

<p>There was a brief silence, then the young man began.</p>

<p>"Mr. de Ronville, you have been the best and kindest
friend a young man could have. I owe you a
great deal. But I would not like to bind myself by
any such promise. I have an old-fashioned notion
that one must or should choose for one's self, and another
perhaps foolish one, that I should like to win
the woman I marry, not have her take me because
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
some one else desired it. She would naturally be impressionable&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>All this talk was about her. She just realized it.
She had listened as if some one was reading out of a
book. She started now, and light and fleet as a deer
flashed across the porch and up to her own room, in
a queer, frightened state, hardly knowing what it
meant, and yet vaguely suspicious. She had not been
especially drawn to Mr. Bartram. He treated her
quite as a child, sometimes teased, and evoked quick,
mirthful replies, at others passed her by indifferently.
All her experience had been with boys, and men of
middle age, and she had no idea of lovers. Did uncle
de Ronville mean that she should come here and love,
and then be married to Mr. Bartram!</p>

<p>She was suddenly and unreasonably homesick for
ugly old Pittsburg. The shops and the drives, the
gayeties and delights, had lost their charm. If she
could fly home to her mother's arms! If she could
sit on her father's knee and have him hug her to his
heart, or even grandad's rough love. And Norah,
and Felix, and grandfather Bradin, who took her out
in his boat, and sang funny sea-going songs. No,
she couldn't come here to live!</p>

<p>Yet it was curious the next morning. Everything
seemed exactly the same. Uncle said, "Will you get
ready for your ride?" in that gentle, courtly manner,
and they went off together. Mr. Bartram had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
been very quiet, she had hardly ventured to raise her
eyes to him.</p>

<p>Oh, maybe she had fallen asleep and dreamed it.</p>

<p>Mary Pemberton came over early. A host of girls
were going to have a picnic up the river, and Belinda
wanted her. They would bring her back by five in
the afternoon. It was to be just a girls' party, only
her brother would be there to see that Darius, the
black servitor, attended to them properly.</p>

<p>It was a bright, jolly day, with swinging, and a
gipsy campfire, playing tag and telling riddles, and
even running races. And she was so joyous talking
it all over that evening, M. de Ronville felt he could
never let her go. Could he persuade her to stay?
Young people were fond of pleasure, and after this
Pittsburg would be dull.</p>

<p>All the week the desire in Daffodil's heart had
grown into absolute longing to go home. Yet she
cares so much for them here: Uncle, Mrs. Jarvis,
Miss Wharton, and a number of other people. But
how could the return be planned. No one had suggested
such a thing.</p>

<p>Providence comes to her assistance, opening the
way in the shape of Mrs. Craig, who stays to supper,
as she has a matter to lay before M. de Ronville.
And that is, that she has finished her visit, and desires
to return before the autumnal rains set in, while the
going is still good. And she will take Daffodil.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span></p>

<p>"I am afraid we can't spare her," returned M. de
Ronville. "She has become such a part of our household."</p>

<p>"But I must go home sometime," said the child
with a quick gasp in her breath.</p>

<p>"Are you tired of us?"</p>

<p>"Tired!" She came and placed her arm caressingly
over his shoulder. "Oh, I have never been
tired, but there is mother and&mdash;the rest," with a
tremble in her voice, while her eyes had the softness
of coming tears. "Think how long I have been
away!"</p>

<p>"And they've had many a heartache, I dare say.
I don't know how they could spare you long. Of
course, where your daughters marry it is a different
thing. You resign yourself to that," said Mrs. Craig.</p>

<p>"When did you think of starting?"</p>

<p>"Well, so as to miss the equinoctial." People
pinned their faith to its coming regularly in those
days. "And perhaps no one would care to take such
a journey if they had no need, and she couldn't come
alone."</p>

<p>"No;" in a grave, slow tone. "We must talk it
over. I've thought of her staying in the winter and
going to school, perhaps. And you might study
music," glancing at her.</p>

<p>"Oh, you are very good. But&mdash;I ought to go."</p>

<p>"Yes. You've had a nice long time, and lots of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
going about, I've heard. I hope you have not been
spoiled. And you are the only girl your mother has.
Then she had you so long before Felix came and
while your father was away, and I know she's missed
you sorely."</p>

<p>The tears did come into Daffodil's eyes then.</p>

<p>After Mrs. Craig had gone, her guardian drew her
down on the sofa beside him.</p>

<p>"Daffodil," he began, "I have come to love you
very dearly. There has been no one in my life to
call forth any special affection. There might have
been, I see now that there should have been. It is
along the last of life that we feel most of the need
of these ties. And if you could give me a little&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I do love you. You have been so kind, and
given me so many pleasures. But not altogether for
that. I liked you when you first came, you know.
There was something&mdash;I can't quite express it&mdash;even
if I had not come to Philadelphia, I should have
thought of you so often. And it has been such a delightful
visit. But I know mother has missed me
very much, and she has the first claim. And oh, I
want to see her."</p>

<p>The longing and piteousness in her tone touched
him. She was not all lightness and pleasure-loving.</p>

<p>"My dear, it is hard to give you up. Child, why
can you not divide some time between us, and let me
do for you as a father would. They have Felix&mdash;and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
each other. They have parents as well. And I
am all alone. It would be a joy to my latter years to
have some one to care for, to share my almost useless
fortune, and my home."</p>

<p>She leaned her golden head down on his shoulder,
and he knew she was crying.</p>

<p>"Oh," she sobbed, "it is very hard. I do love
you. But, you see, they have the best right, and I
love them. I am torn in two."</p>

<p>Yes, it was selfish to try her this way. He had
dreamed of what might happen if he could keep her
here, a girl sweet and lovely enough to charm any
one. But it was wrong thus to covet, to make it
harder for her.</p>

<p>"My child, it shall be as you wish. Sometime you
may like to come again. My home and heart will always
be open to you, and I shall study your best interests.
When you want any favor do not hesitate to
ask me. I shall be only too glad to do anything."</p>

<p>"Oh, do not think me ungrateful for all this love
and kindness. Every day I shall think of you. Yes,"
and the brightness in her tone thrilled him. "I
may come again if you want me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I shall always want you, remember that."</p>

<p>M. de Ronville was not the only one who made an
outcry. Miss Wharton took her to task.</p>

<p>"Daffodil, you are not old enough to realize what
a foolish girl you are, and so we must not be too
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
severe. Mr. de Ronville is a rich man, a fine and
noble one as well. I have no doubt but that he would
leave you a handsome portion, for he loves you sincerely.
And think of the advantages of a city like
this. But when you go back to Pittsburg, you will
see a great difference. If all is true, there is no
society, no interest for such a woman as you may become
with proper training, such as you would get
here. You are&mdash;yes, I will say it, too lovely to be
wasted on a place like that. I am really vexed with
you."</p>

<p>The tears stood in her beautiful eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh, one can't be angry with you, you are so
sweet! A year or two hence you could have no end
of admirers at your feet, and take your pick of them.
I hate to give you up. I want to see you a queen in
society, you lovely, winsome, short-sighted thing!
I don't believe you have a bit of vanity, and they say
no girl child was ever born without it. I shall make
your uncle, as you call him, keep track of you, for I
shall want to know where you throw away your sweetness.
I believe if I was Mr. de Ronville I would
offer to buy you from your father."</p>

<p>"Oh, he couldn't."</p>

<p>It sounded as if she said it exultantly.</p>

<p>Jane bemoaned the proposed departure as well.</p>

<p>"The house will feel just like a funeral when you
have gone out of it, Miss Daffodil. You've been like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
the sunshine floating up and down. We never missed
it on the rainiest day, for there was your flashing
golden head. And, oh, I wish you could stay and,
grow up a young woman, and go to parties, and then
have a splendid lover. Oh, dear!" and then Jane
broke down crying.</p>

<p>Poor Daffodil's heart was torn by the regrets. It
seemed as if uncle was the only one who was like
to help her bear the parting, and he was so tender
that at times she almost relented. Mr. Bartram did
not count. He was polite, and to a degree sympathetic.
He did not tease her, nor laugh about Pittsburg,
that would have made her indignant now.</p>

<p>She had come with such a little parcel, now there
was a trunk to be packed. M. de Ronville slipped in
some dainty little boxes that were not to be opened
until she reached home. And at last the day came,
and there were sad enough good-by's.</p>

<p>There was a new Post coach in its shining paint,
and four stout horses. Mr. de Ronville pressed Daffodil's
hand the last one, but he turned his eyes away.
Yes, the light of his house had gone. But he could
not give up all hope.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER X<br />
<br />
THE PASSING OF THE OLD</h2>

<p>Oh, how queer it looked at Old Pittsburg, after the
fine city she had left. Daffodil almost shrank from
the sight of the old dilapidated log houses, the streets
that were still lanes. But there were the two households
to greet her, with not a change in them. Oh,
how dear they were! The familiar room, the chair so
endeared to her, the high shelf, with its brass candlestick,
and there in the corner her mother's little flax
wheel.</p>

<p>"We were so afraid they'd keep you," said Felix.
"Didn't they want you to stay?"</p>

<p>"Ah, yes," and the tears came to her eyes.</p>

<p>"And you look queer, changed somehow. Your
voice has a funny sound. And I want you to tell me
all about Philadelphia. Did you see that Mr. Benjamin
Franklin, and the men who signed the Declaration
of Independence?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Franklin was abroad. And they don't all
live there. I believe I saw only three of them. But
there was Governor Mifflin. And they hope sometime
to have the Capitol there."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span></p>

<p>"Felix, let your sister have a little rest. There
will be days and days to talk. Dilly, are you not tired
to death? Such a long journey as it is. I don't see
how Mrs. Craig stood it."</p>

<p>"Yes, I am tired," she answered. How plain her
room looked, though it had been put in nice order
with the best knitted white quilt on her bed, and a
bowl of flowers on a pretty new stand grandfather
Bradin had made. She hung her coat in the closet,
and took off the frock she was so tired of, glad to
change it for a fresher one.</p>

<p>"Now you look natural," declared grandmere.
"We have our little girl back, but it does seem as if
you had grown. And, oh, how glad we are to have
her!"</p>

<p>There certainly was some mysterious change. Her
mother studied it as well. It seemed as if the little
girl had vanished, one could almost imagine the seven
years had come and gone, and she had been to fairyland.
But she put her face down on her mother's
shoulder and cried.</p>

<p>"Dear, are you glad to see us all again, to come
back to us? For I have had a heart-breaking fear
that I know it must have been delightful there, and
Mr. de Ronville had a great love for you. Oh, I
really wonder that he let you come."</p>

<p>"He wanted me to stay&mdash;yes. To stay and be
educated in music and many things. It is so different
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
there. I don't know that I can make you understand."</p>

<p>"Dear," subjoined her mother, "he wrote to us.
It was the kindliest letter. If he had persuaded
you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>They clung more closely together, each answering
with the pressure. But she made no mention of Mr.
Bartram. The talk had not been meant for her ears,
indeed, she did not rightly understand the real desire
that underlay it.</p>

<p>"Now you must rest awhile," said her mother.
"There will be a crowd in to supper."</p>

<p>Felix had been denied the pleasure of a half holiday.
"You will have time enough to see your sister,"
Barbe said to the importunate boy. "She is going
to stay at home now."</p>

<p>Daffodil did have a nap and awoke refreshed,
though she still looked tired and pale.</p>

<p>"Put on one of your pretty frocks," said her
mother, with a touch of pride. Indeed, much as she
had missed her darling she had enjoyed the honor.
Not every girl could have such an opportunity to see
the great city where so many notable events had happened.
There were few formal invitations in those
early days. Evenings were generally given over to
pleasure, for the day was devoted to work. You were
sure of a welcome unless somewhere there was a family
feud and even that was often overlooked after a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
few glasses of whiskey. So there were guests in&mdash;to
supper. Daffodil was inspected, questioned, commented
upon in a friendly fashion. They drank to
her health, to the fact of her return safe and sound,
for, after all, was not a big city where they had all
sorts of dissipations dangerous.</p>

<p>But all that was nothing to the evening. Then
there was a crowd. Grandad did get very merry
and dance a jig, the laughter grew uproarious.
Dilly shrank with a fear that was half disgust.</p>

<p>Barbe caught Norah's arm presently.</p>

<p>"Ask them over to finish their merriment," she said
persuasively. "Daffodil is very tired and must go
to bed."</p>

<p>She looked like a little ghost now and her eyes
were heavy.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; we ought to have a little thought," and
Norah rapped on the table and gave her invitation,
which was cordially accepted.</p>

<p>"Dear little daughter," began her father. "It's
rather wild and rough, but it is their idea of a good,
hearty welcome. And you must pardon grandad. He
has a warm, loving heart."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; I know all that. But I <i>am</i> tired." And
her voice was full of tears.</p>

<p>"Oh, child, it would be hard to have you outgrow
us. And I love you so! I had such hard work to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
win your love in the beginning. But you don't remember."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I do. Was I dreadful? I think I
couldn't love any one all at once. And I didn't like
mother to care so, when she had loved me best. But
I know better now. Her love for me is different
from her love for Felix and her love for you. Oh, I
am glad to be back." And she clung to him convulsively.</p>

<p>He hoped in his heart she would never go away
again. There were some promising beaux in the town.
Of course she would marry. He wouldn't want his
little girl to be an "old maid."</p>

<p>She said a long prayer that night, it seemed as if
there had never been so many things to pray for.
Then she crawled into bed and cried softly, she did
not know why. Did she wish herself back?</p>

<p>Was it that the place had changed so much or was
it all in her. Felix seemed such a big boy, good looking
too, with beautiful dark eyes and a very rosy
face much sunburned. His dark hair was a mass of
clustering curls, they inherited that from their
mother. But he talked with his mouth full, he
clattered his knife and fork, dropped them occasionally,
and asked more questions than one could answer
in an hour.</p>

<p>She looked up at her father and smiled her approval.
He understood it was that. He had some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
gentlemanly ways and she was very glad that M. de
Ronville had not been shocked by the rude manners
that obtained largely in the town. Grandmere waited
on the table for there was generally a second cooking.
People had stout appetites in those days.</p>

<p>It seemed to her the trees had grown, they were
longer armed. And here was the pretty flower garden
a-bloom now with marigolds, which were not
field flowers. There were large balls of pale yellow
and deep orange, bronze ones with a pile as if made
of velvet. How beautiful they were. Not a weed
was to be seen.</p>

<p>It was a half-cloudy day, not dark or sullen, but
with friendly gray under roof. She put on her sun-bonnet,
her mother had it starched and ironed for her.
Up at the back of the house it was still wild land, a
sloping hill, a tangle of summer growth rhododendrons
half smothered with it. She threaded her way
up, then there was a long level of stubble turning
brown. Far to the north vaster bulks loomed up.
There was a great world beyond. What if some day
it should be cities like Philadelphia. And&mdash;people,
men and women living in pretty houses and having
nice times.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful world, too. There was the fragrance
of wild grapes in the air, the sweetness of
dying clover blooms and the rich autumnal smells.
She drew long breaths and broke into song with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
birds. Then she started and ran. How little the
houses looked down there!</p>

<p>"Oh," she cried in dismay as she ran through the
open doorway, "is it dinner time. I've been up in
the woods. It <i>is</i> beautiful."</p>

<p>Her mother looked up smilingly. She had been
paring apples to dry and had a great tubful. They
strung them on a cord and hung them out in the sunshine
to dry. Grandmere had the dinner ready to
dish up.</p>

<p>"Oh, I could have been stringing the apples!" she
said remorsefully. "And I've been way up the hill.
I wondered if it would look so lovely to me. For
the Schuylkill is like a dream, but our rivers are finer
than the Delaware."</p>

<p>"Don't worry about work so soon. You must get
used to it by degrees. And get rested over the journey.
Janie and Kate Byerly were in. They want you
to come to supper to-morrow night. Janie has a
lover and she's promised. 'Tisn't a good sign when
the youngest goes off first."</p>

<p>"Why, Janie isn't&mdash;&mdash;" in surprise.</p>

<p>"She was fifteen a month ago;" said grandmere.</p>

<p>"Would you want me to get married?" she asked
soberly, recalling the talk she could not confess for
honor's sake.</p>

<p>"We are in no hurry," said grandmere. "Though
I approve of early marriages. You settle to one another
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
more easily. And women are happier in their
own homes."</p>

<p>"I'll get father to put up an addition and bring my
husband here;" she rejoined with a kind of reckless
gayety. "I couldn't go very far away from you."</p>

<p>Her mother glanced up with fond eyes. And just
then her father entered.</p>

<p>Most people at that time were little given to caressing
ways. But his own had been much dearer to Bernard
Carrick after his three years' absence, and now
he kissed his daughter, taking her sweet face in both
hands.</p>

<p>"Why, you look fresh as a rose. I half expected
to find you in bed. Are you equal to a ride this afternoon?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; only&mdash;mother&mdash;&mdash;" glancing at her.</p>

<p>"Can't mother spare you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes. There will be time enough to work,
child."</p>

<p>Her mother was made very happy at the deference.</p>

<p>Felix did not always come home at noon.</p>

<p>"They were pretty gay last night," he began apologetically.
"Seen grandad this morning?"</p>

<p>"No, I went up in the woods. I wondered how it
would look to me. It was beautiful. And it was a
shame not to run over there first."</p>

<p>"Well, you may go a bit before we start. I have
some papers to look over. We're in a great wrastle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
about some whiskey business. And now a man has
to hold his tongue sharp if he isn't on the right
side."</p>

<p>"You are on the right side?" She looked at him
with laughing, trusting eyes.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't dare go agin grandad," he laughed
back.</p>

<p>It was the old time to her. The cloth was coarse
homespun partly bleached; they had some fine ones
laid away for the little girl's outfit; the dishes were a
motley lot, some pewter plates among them. The
pretty accessories that she had become so accustomed
to were missing. Was it this way when M. de Ronville
was here? She colored vividly.</p>

<p>"I'll get up, Doll," her father said, "and stop for
you." So she ran down to the other house.</p>

<p>Norah kissed her effusively.</p>

<p>"I'm glad you weren't in this morning. I was on
thorns an' briars all the time for fear. The men were
in howling an' shouting until you'd thought they'd upset
the government. An' they will, too. We're not
going to pay tax on our very bread. Why they're
coming the old game that they fit about for seven
years. And grandad's fierce. He'd turn us all back
to England to-morrer."</p>

<p>"I don't know&mdash;&mdash;" Daffodil looked up confused.</p>

<p>"No, I s'pose not. Women has husbands to think
for them an' gals needn't think about anything but

beaux. Did you have any over there?" nodding her
head. "Body o' me! but you've grown tall. You ain't
a little girl any more. And we'll have to look you up a
nice beau."</p>

<p>"Must everybody be married?"</p>

<p>Norah put both hands on her lips and laughed.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know as there's a <i>must</i>, only old
maids ain't of much account an' get sticks poked at
'em pretty often. I wouldn't be one for any money.
I'd go out in the woods and ask the first man I met
to marry me."</p>

<p>"How old must you be?" asked Daffodil soberly,
thinking of Miss Wharton.</p>

<p>"Well, if you ain't married by twenty, lovers ain't
so plenty, and at twenty-four you're pushed out of
the door and at thirty you might as well go down.
But you're not likely to have to ring the bell for them.
My! but you're pretty, only I wish your cheeks
were redder. I guess you've been housed up too
much. I want to hear all about the sort of
time you had! Wasn't the old gentleman a little
stiff?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no. He seemed so much like great-grandfather
to me. I loved him a great deal. And there
was a splendid housekeeper. The maid was sweet
and she cried when I came away."</p>

<p>"Little Girl," called her father.</p>

<p>"Oh, are you going to ride away? Come over to-night.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
Grandad is going to the meeting where they
will spout like a leaky gargoyle. Or stay, your father
will go too. I'll come over instead."</p>

<p>Daffodil mounted Dolly, who certainly had not
grown fat in her absence. Felix had attended to
that. "Dear old Dolly!" patting her neck, and the
mare whinnied as if overjoyed.</p>

<p>"You haven't forgotten, dear old Dolly;" and
Daffodil was minded to lean over and give her a hug
as she had times before.</p>

<p>"We'll go down town. We are stretching out our
borders. Here is the new dock. We are building
boats for the western trade, and here is the shipyard."</p>

<p>It had doubled itself since spring. Everybody
seemed hurrying to and fro. Brawny, sunburned men
with shirt sleeves rolled nearly to the shoulders, jesting,
whistling, sometimes swearing, the younger ones
pausing now and then to indulge in a few jig steps.
There were boats loading with a variety of freight,
but largely whiskey. Carrick took some drawings out
of his memorandum book.</p>

<p>"Look them over sharp, Cap'n Boyle, though I
think you'll find them all right."</p>

<p>There was the long point, the two rivers flowing
into the Ohio, the murmur like the undertone of the
sea. And over beyond, far beyond an endless stretch.
There were some Indian wigwams, there were long
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
reaches of cornfields yet uncut, a few stacked; apples
ripening in the mellow sunshine, a wild kind of fruit,
great tangles of grapevine enough to smother any
tree.</p>

<p>"It is beautiful," she said with deep feeling. "Oh,
do you suppose there'll ever be anything&mdash;over there&mdash;like
a town, houses and such?"</p>

<p>She nodded upward. That was her portion.</p>

<p>"If we go on this way. There's a line for trade
between this and Cincinnati all planned out, boats
being built, there's coal and iron to supply places
around, and they're talking about glass even. We
shall be the head centre. Oh, land doesn't cost much
since taxes are so light. Yes, some likely young fellow
will take it in hand and evolve a fortune for
you. Daffodil, you will not go back to de Ronville?"</p>

<p>"To live? Oh, no."</p>

<p>"I couldn't spare my little girl. I want you to
marry and settle here."</p>

<p>She seemed to shrink from the thought.</p>

<p>Down here they were working streets. New houses
were going up. Store-houses were being built. Carrick
had to stop and discuss several openings. And
no matter what subject was in hand it came round to
the whiskey.</p>

<p>"What is it all about, father?" she asked, raising
her perplexed face to his.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't know that you can understand. We were
all served with a summons in the summer to appear
at court over the other side of the mountains. Crops
were just at the point where they would be ruined if
left. The distillers were very angry, the farmers, too.
They held meetings and decided they wouldn't go.
It's a matter of the general government. The country
is behind in everything and is striving to meet its
expenses. It could not be otherwise after such a war
as we have had. The tax is four pence per gallon&mdash;it
seems a big figure on hundreds of gallons, still they
can recoup themselves on the other end."</p>

<p>"And who is right?"</p>

<p>Bernard Carrick laughed.</p>

<p>"There is but one side to be on just now. Grandad
is among the distillers and Norah is as hotheaded
as he. But women ought to stay out of it.
Take pattern by mother and grandmere and have no
opinions. You can't help hearing it talked about.
I'm glad it wasn't one of M. de Ronville's interests
or you might have heard hard things said about us.
There now, business is done, let us have a fine gallop
over this road."</p>

<p>Dolly went very well for a while then said plainly
she could not keep it up.</p>

<p>"You are a good rider, Dilly. I'm glad you did
not get out of practice. Your guardian must have
been indulgent."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span></p>

<p>"We had a ride every fine morning. He was very
fond of it."</p>

<p>He was glad to have her talk about her visit. The
life would be very different here. Not only were all
his interests here, and he was getting to be one of
the rising men of the town, but the Bradins held the
house they lived in and he was as a son to them.
Barbe had never been parted from her mother. And
though he had gone to his country's call with their
consent he knew his own father would never forgive
a second defection. No, he must stay here, and his
daughter must marry here.</p>

<p>Felix begged her to come out with him and see the
great bee tree where father was going to take up the
honey some night, but she was tired and curled
herself up in the grandfather chair. Her thoughts
wandered a little.</p>

<p>"I don't believe you are paying a bit of attention
to me!" the boy flung out angrily. "I wish you
hadn't gone to that old city. You were twice as good
fun before. And I s'pose you won't climb trees or run
races or&mdash;or do any of the things that used to be such
good fun. What in the world <i>did</i> you do there?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll try them with you again. But I've been
out with father all the afternoon&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And now he'll be so taken up with you he won't
want me. Girls haven't any call to be out so much
with men."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span></p>

<p>"Not when they are our own fathers?" smiling.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;there's knitting, and spinning, and sewing,
and darning stockings&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I thought you were begging me to go out and
have a good romp with you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that's different."</p>

<p>She laughed. Then father came in and they had
supper. After that until he went out he had to help
Felix with sums, then the boy was sleepy, and went
to bed.</p>

<p>Daffodil had to talk about her visit. She had been
to the theatre twice and to some fine out-of-doors
concerts. Then the afternoon at the Pembertons,
where the ladies had been so beautifully dressed, and
the dance and the tea on the lawn. She had been sent
to a dancing class and knew the modern steps.</p>

<p>"And I just don't believe any one can beat grandad;"
said Norah with pride. "And stout as he is,
he's as light on his feet as a young girl. And about
this Miss Wharton and her living alone with servants
just as if she was a widow, and she must be an
old maid. It's queer they should make so much of
her."</p>

<p>"But she's so nice and sweet. Everybody likes
her. And her house is so full of pretty things. The
gentlemen are always wanting to dance with her and
come to tea."</p>

<p>"Well, it's very queer except for a queen. There
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
was a great queen once who didn't and wouldn't get
married."</p>

<p>"That was Queen Elizabeth and Virginia was
named in her honor."</p>

<p>"Well, I hope you won't get sick of us after a
little. But blood's thicker than water;" and Norah
nodded confidently to Daffodil's mother.</p>

<p>Then it seemed really strange to go over to the
Byerly's to tea. They had been older girls in school.
Now they were busy all day spinning and Kate wove
on a hand loom. Girls worked through the day and
frolicked in the evening. They all seemed so large to
Daffodil. They joked one another about beaux.
Half a dozen young men were invited. Kitchen and
dining-room was all one, and the two tables were put
together, and would have groaned with their burden
if they had not been strong.</p>

<p>"I want Daffodil Carrick," said Ned Langdale
rather peremptorily. "I went to her first party and
she came to mine."</p>

<p>"That's whether she wants you," said Janie
saucily. "Do you, Daffodil?"</p>

<p>"Do I&mdash;what?"</p>

<p>"Want Ned to take you in to supper. We're pairing
off. By right you ought to take Kate," to Ned.
"She can have some of the younger boys."</p>

<p>Daffodil was rather startled at Ned. He had grown
so tall and looked so manly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll take Archie," she said a little timidly.</p>

<p>Archie smiled and came over to her, clasping her
hand.</p>

<p>"I'm so glad," he said in a half whisper. "Oh,
Daffodil, you're so pretty, like some of the sweet pictures
in a book mother has. Yes, I'm so glad."</p>

<p>Did Daffodil go to school with most of these girls?
She felt curiously strange. After the first greeting
and the question about her visit, that she was getting
rather tired of, there was a new diversion at the
entrance of Mr. Josephus Sanders, who was announced
to the company by his betrothed. He was
a great, rather coarse-looking fellow, with a red face
burned by wind and water, and reddish hair that
seemed to stand up all over his head. Even at the
back it hardly lay down. He was a boatman, had
made two trips to New Orleans, and now was going
regular between Pittsburg and Cincinnati with a share
in the boat which he meant to own by and by. He
had a loud voice and took the jesting in good
part, giving back replies of coarse wit and much
laughter.</p>

<p>Mrs. Byerly waited on the guests, though the viands
were so arranged that there was a dish for every
three or four. Cold chicken, cold ham, cold roast
pork temptingly sliced. White bread and brown,
fried nuts as they called them, the old Dutch doughnuts
and spiced cakes, beside the great round one cut
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
in generous slices. And after that luscious fruits of
all kinds.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am so glad to see you. And you have
been off among the quality. But I hope you have not
forgotten&mdash;" and he raised his eyes, then colored and
added, "but you weren't so much with the boys. I
do suppose girls' schools are different. Still there
were Saturdays."</p>

<p>"I don't know why I lagged behind," and she gave
a soft laugh that was delicious. "Maybe it was because
some of them were older. Even now I feel like
a little girl and I don't mean to be married in a long
time. Oh, yes, I remember the May day fun and the
races and tag&mdash;&mdash;" pausing.</p>

<p>"And the tree climbing and the big jumps and
prisoner's base, and 'open the gates' and 'tug of
war.' Ned was famous in them. I liked often to go off
by myself and read, but once in a while it was fun."</p>

<p>"Oh, you should go to Philadelphia. There are so
many fine books. And many of the people have
libraries of their own. My guardian had. And pictures."</p>

<p>He bent his head quite low.</p>

<p>"I'm going some day. That's my secret. I mean
to be a doctor."</p>

<p>"Oh!" The eyes she turned upon him thrilled
him to the heart. Oh, she was the prettiest and
sweetest girl in the room.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span></p>

<p>But she wasn't glowing and red-cheeked and black-eyed.
Then yellow hair wasn't particularly in favor.</p>

<p>The table was cleared and the dessert was grapes
and melons, yellow-hearted cantelopes and rosy watermelons,
and they snapped seeds at one another, a
rather rude play, which made a great deal of dodging.
Afterward they went to the best room and had
some more refined plays. They "picked cherries,"
they had to call their sweetheart and stand with him
in the middle of the room. Ned chose Daffodil Carrick
and he kissed her of course, that made her
blush like a peony. And she chose Archie.</p>

<p>But, alas! Archie had to choose some one else.
He said afterward&mdash;"I had a great mind to choose
you again, but I knew they'd laugh and say it wasn't
fair. But I didn't care at all for Emma Watkins."</p>

<p>They wound up with "Oats, Peas, Beans, and Barley
Grows." Then Janie Byerly took her betrothed's
hand and stood in the middle of the room.</p>

<p>"Joe and I are to be married in October somewhere
about the middle. We haven't set the day yet,
but you'll all know it and I want a great crowd to
come and see the knot tied. Then we're going to Cincinnati
on Joe's boat to visit his folks, and if I like it
first-class we may settle there. I hope you have all
had a good time."</p>

<p>They said they had in a shout.</p>

<p>"I'm coming over to see your pretty frocks," Janie
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
whispered to Daffodil. "My, I shall be so busy that
my head will spin."</p>

<p>Of course Archie had to see her home, but as
Ned's girl was already home, he walked with them
and did most of the talking, to Archie's chagrin. And
he ended with&mdash;"I've so much to tell you. I'm coming
over right soon."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI<br />
<br />
THE WOOF OF DAILY THINGS</h2>

<p>"Dilly, you're not worth shucks since you came
back!" exclaimed the boy in a severely upbraiding
tone. "You don't do nothin' as you used, you just
sit and moon. Do you want to go back to that old
man? I sh'd think you'd been awful dull."</p>

<p>"Do you talk that way at school?"</p>

<p>"Oh, well, a fellow needn't be so fussy at home."</p>

<p>"What would you like me to do? You are off with
the boys&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's because you're no good. You don't run
races nor climb trees nor wade in the brook to catch
frogs, nor jump&mdash;I'll bet you don't know how to
jump any more. And you were a staver!"</p>

<p>"Girls leave off those things. And you are a good
deal younger, and ought to have a boy's good times.
I must sew and spin and help keep house and work in
the garden to take care of the flowers and learn to
cook."</p>

<p>"My! I wouldn't be a girl for anything! Dilly,
who will you marry?"</p>

<p>Her face was scarlet. Must a girl marry? She
understood now the drift of the talk she had unwittingly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
overheard. And her cheek burned thinking
that she had been offered and declined.</p>

<p>"I'm not going to marry any one in a good while,"
she returned gravely.</p>

<p>"Tim Garvin asked me&mdash;&mdash;" he looked at her
hesitatingly.</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"If he might come round. He thinks you sing like
a mocking bird. And he says he likes yellow hair.
I don't. I wish yours was black and that you had red
cheeks and that you'd laugh real loud, and want to
play games."</p>

<p>"There are plenty of little girls, Felix, who are
ready for any sort of fun."</p>

<p>He spun round on his heel and went off. It had
been one of the resplendent early autumn days with a
breath of summer in the air and the richness of all
ripening things. The call of the wood thrush came
softly through the trees with a lingering delicious tenderness.
She sat on a large boulder nearly at the foot
of a great sycamore tree. She used to have a play-house
here. What had changed her so? She did not
want to go back to Philadelphia. She would never
want to see Mr. Bartram again. In a way she was
content. Her father loved her very much, it was a
stronger love in one way, a man's love, though her
mother was tender and planning a nice future for her.</p>

<p>She did not understand that it was the dawning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
of womanhood, the opening of a new, strange life different
from what had gone before. There was a sort
of delicious mystery about it and she stood in tremulous
awe. It was going to bring her something that
she half dreaded, half desired.</p>

<p>She had gone down by the schoolhouse one afternoon.
They had built a new one, really quite smart,
and now they had taken off an hour of the last session.
The children were out at play, racing, screaming,
wrestling, here playing ring around a rosy, here
London bridge is falling down, here a boy chasing a
girl and kissing her roughly, she slapping his face and
being kissed half a dozen times more. Had she ever
been one of this boisterous, romping group?</p>

<p>The French blood had brought in more refinement,
like the Quaker element. And she had been rather
diffident. At home they were more delicate, while
they had too much good breeding and kindliness to
hold themselves much above their neighbors.</p>

<p>The marriage of Janie Byerly was quite an event.
It took place at ten in the morning and there was a
great wedding cake with slices for the girls to dream
on. Then they went down to the boat in a procession
and there was a merry time as the boat made ready
to push out. Rice had not come in yet, but old shoes
were there in abundance.</p>

<p>There were other marriages and the little girl went
to them because she did not want to slight her old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
companions. Some of the couples set up housekeeping
in a two-roomed cabin and the new wife went
on with her spinning or weaving and some of them
were quite expert at tailoring. There was plenty of
work getting ready for winter.</p>

<p>Tim Garvin had been as good as his word and came
on Sunday evening. Daffodil sheltered herself behind
her father's protecting wing. They talked of the
whiskey question, of the Ohio trade, and then there
was a lagging, rather embarrassing time. Four
elderly people sat around&mdash;they generally retired and
gave the young folks a chance, but it was Daffodil
who disappeared first. And Tim did not make a
second attempt.</p>

<p>The Langdale boys had better luck in establishing
friendliness. Ned came over in high feather one
afternoon. Daffodil was practising a rather intricate
piece of lace making. He looked manly and proud.
He was tall and well filled out, very well looking.</p>

<p>"I hope you'll all congratulate me," he began in a
buoyant tone. "I've enlisted. I'm going to live up at
the Fort and begin soldier life in earnest."</p>

<p>"And I do most heartily wish you success," declared
grandmere, her eyes lighting up with a kind of
admiration at the manly face in the pride of youth.
"We shall need soldiers many a day yet, though I hope
the worst is over. Still the Indians are treacherous
and stubborn."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span></p>

<p>"And we may have another fight on our hands;"
laughing. "For we are not going to be ridden over
rough shod."</p>

<p>"But you must belong to the government side now."</p>

<p>"I suppose so;" flushing.</p>

<p>The delinquent distillers had been summoned to
Philadelphia and had refused to go.</p>

<p>"This is our very living," declared grandad, who
was one of the most fiery insurgents. "Then they
will tax our grain, our crops of all kinds. A king
could do no worse! What did I tell you about these
men! Why, we'll have to emigrate t'other side of the
Mississippi and start a new town. That's all we get
for our labor and hard work."</p>

<p>"I ought to have waited until this thing was settled,"
Ned said rather ruefully, studying Daffodil's
face. "But I had hard work to coax father, and
when he consented I rushed off at once. He thinks
there's going to be fortunes in this iron business, and
Archie won't be worth shucks at it. He hates it as
much as I do, but he's all for books, and getting his
living by his brains. Maybe he'll be a lawyer."</p>

<p>Daffodil flushed. She held Archie's secret.</p>

<p>"You don't like it," Ned began when he had persuaded
her to walk a little way with him. "You said
once you didn't like soldiering. Yet it is a noble profession,
and I'm not going to stay down at the bottom
of the line."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span></p>

<p>"No," with a sweet reluctance as if she was sorry
to admit it. "It seems cruel to me, why men should
like to kill each other."</p>

<p>"They don't like it in the way of enjoyment, but
do their duty. And they are for the protection of the
homes, the women and children. We may have another
Indian raid; we have some"&mdash;then he paused,
he was going to say, "some French to clear out," but
refrained. The French still held some desirable
western points.</p>

<p>"Father talks of the war occasionally, and mother
shivers and says&mdash;'My heart would have broken if
I had known that!' And to be away three years or
more, never knowing if one was alive!"</p>

<p>No, she wouldn't do for a soldier's wife. And
Archie had prefigured himself a bachelor; he really
had nothing to fear there, only would she not take
more interest in his brother? There were other
young fellows in the town, but not many of her kind.
Well, he would wait&mdash;she seemed quite like a child
yet.</p>

<p>Somehow she had not made the same impression as
she had in Philadelphia. No one praised her hair
or her beautiful complexion or her grace in dancing.
It did not hurt her exactly, but she felt sorry she could
not please as readily. Only&mdash;she did not care for that
kind of florid approbation.</p>

<p>Grandmere looked up from her work when they had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
gone out. "He is a fine lad," she commented. "And
they are of a good family. Daffodil is nearing sixteen.
Though there doesn't seem much need of
soldiers&mdash;it is a noble profession. It seems just the
thing for him."</p>

<p>"She is such a child yet. I don't know how we
could spare her. And her father is so fond of her."</p>

<p>Mrs. Bradin had a rather coveting regard for the
young man. And a pretty girl like Daffodil should not
hang on hand.</p>

<p>Ned Langdale made friends easily at the Fort. And
during the second month, on account of a little misbehavior
in the ranks, he was advanced to the sergeantship.</p>

<p>Meanwhile feeling ran higher and higher. Those
who understood that the power of the general government
must be the law of the land were compelled
to keep silence lest they should make matters worse.
Even the clergy were forced to hold their peace.
Processes were served and thrown into the fire or torn
to bits. Then the government interfered and troops
were ordered out.</p>

<p>Bernard Carrick had tried to keep his father within
bounds. It did not do to protest openly, but he felt the
government should be obeyed, or Pittsburg would be
the loser. Bradford and several others ordered the
troops to march to Braddock's field, and then to Pittsburg.
The town was all astir and in deadly terror
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
lest if the insurgents could not rule they would ruin.
But after all it was a bloodless revolution. Governor
Mifflin, after a temperate explanation, softening some
of the apparently arbitrary points, commanded the
insurgents to disperse. Breckenridge thought it safest
to give good words rather than powder and balls. So
they marched through the town in excellent order and
came out on the plains of the Monogahela where the
talking was softened with libations of whiskey, and
a better understanding prevailed, the large distillers
giving in to the majesty of the law.</p>

<p>Some of the still disgruntled insurgents set fire to
several barns, but no special damage was done. And
thus ended the year's turmoil and business went on
with renewed vigor. There was also an influx of
people, some to settle, others from curiosity. But the
West was awakening a new interest and calling for
immigrants.</p>

<p>Mrs. Janie Sanders came back with glowing accounts
of the town on the Ohio. And now trade was
fairly established by the line of boats. And from
there down to New Orleans continual traffic was
established.</p>

<p>The older log houses were disappearing or turned
into kitchens with a finer exterior in front. People
began to laugh at the old times when there was much
less than a thousand inhabitants.</p>

<p>And though Bernard Carrick still called his daughter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
"Little Girl," she was quite grown up with a slim
lissome figure and her golden hair was scarcely a
shade darker. She was past sixteen, and yet she had
never had a lover. Young men dropped in of a Sunday
afternoon or evening, but she seemed to act as if
they were her father's guests. After two or three
attempts they dropped out again.</p>

<p>Archie had gone to Philadelphia for a year at a
preparatory school, then was to enter college. Ned
now was first lieutenant, having been promoted for
bravery and foresight in warding off an Indian sortie
that might have been a rather serious matter.</p>

<p>The little girl had vanished with the old Pittsburg.
She hardly knew herself in these days. Something
seemed to touch her with a magic wand. She was full
of joy with all things of the outside world, and the
spring and the early summer, nature seemed to speak
in all manner of wooing tongues and she answered.
She took long walks in the woods and came home with
strange new flowers. There was not much to read, it
was not a season of intellectuality but a busy, thrifty
time laying the foundation for the great city of industry
and prosperity that was to be.</p>

<p>Barbe Carrick made pretty garments with fine
needlework and lace and laid them by in an old oaken
chest. Grandmere was sometimes a little impatient
over the dreaming child. Another year was going and
she had counted on Daffodil being married before the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
next generation of girls came to the fore. Plain ones,
loud, awkward ones were married and had a jollification.
Some of them at twenty had three or four children.</p>

<p>She was very sweet, charming and helpful. Grandad
had taken the "knuckling down," as he called it,
rather hard, but it seemed as if the tax and more came
back in increased sales. He was very fond of small
Sandy, now a fast-growing boy, but there was a different
love for Daffodil, who looked over his accounts,
read the paper to him, and listened to his stories as
well as his complaints.</p>

<p>"I wish it wasn't so much the fashion for girls to
marry," he said one day to Norah. "I don't know
how we could spare Dilly."</p>

<p>"And keep her an old maid!" with scorn in her
voice. "But it's queer! One would think lovers
would buzz about her like bees."</p>

<p>Now and then there came a letter from Philadelphia
that she answered with a good long one, yet she wondered
afterward what she found to say. That visit
seemed such a long, long while ago, almost in another
life. And Mistress Betty Wharton had married and
gone to Paris, as her husband was connected with
the embassy. There were many questions yet to
settle.</p>

<p>"Don't you want to go over to the Fort with me,
Daffodil?" her father asked one afternoon. He had a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
fondness for Lieutenant Langdale, and not the
slightest objection to him as a future son-in-law.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," eagerly, and joined him, smiling under
the great hat with its flaring front filled in with gathered
silk, her white frock short enough to show the
trim ankles and dainty feet, and her green silk parasol
that had come from Philadelphia that very spring.
She generally wore her hair in curls, though it was
cut much shorter in the front and arranged not unlike
more modern finger puffs. A very pretty girl of the
refined type.</p>

<p>Fort Pitt was then in all its glory though the old
block house of Colonel Bouquet was still standing,
up Duquesne way, and there were soldiers strolling
about and a few officers in uniform.</p>

<p>Langdale was on duty somewhere. Captain Forbes
came to greet them.</p>

<p>"You'll find the general in his office, Mr. Carrick.
May I take charge of Miss Carrick, meanwhile?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I shall be glad to have you."</p>

<p>Captain Forbes was a Philadelphian, so they were
not at loss for conversation. Here two or three men
were in earnest discussion, there one deeply interested
in a book, who touched his cap without looking up.
In a shady corner two men were playing chess, one
a civilian, the other a young private.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, Hugh, how goes it?" asked the captain.</p>

<p>"Why, I am not discouraged;" laughing and bowing
to Daffodil.</p>

<p>"He is going to make a good, careful player, and I
think a fine soldier."</p>

<p>"Allow me&mdash;Mr. Andsdell, Miss Carrick."</p>

<p>There had come with General Lee and his body of
soldiers sent to quell the insurgents, a number of citizens
out of curiosity to see the place. Among them
a young Englishman, who had been in the country
several years seeking his fortune and having various
successes. He had tried the stage at Williamsburg,
Virginia, and won not a little applause. He was an
agreeable well-mannered person and always had excellent
luck at cards without being a regular gamester.
He made no secret of belonging to a titled family, but
being a younger son with four lives between him and
the succession he had come to America to try his fortune.
Yet even in this new world fortunes were not
so easily found or made.</p>

<p>Daffodil watched them with interest. M. de Ronville
had played it with an elderly friend.</p>

<p>"You have seen it before?" Andsdell asked, raising
his eyes and meeting the interested ones.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; in Philadelphia. I spent a few months
there."</p>

<p>Her voice had a charm. She seemed indeed not an
ordinary girl.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span></p>

<p>"I have been there part of the last year. I was
much interested."</p>

<p>He kept a wary eye on the young fellow's moves.</p>

<p>Once he said&mdash;"No, don't do that; think."</p>

<p>The other thought to some purpose and smiled.</p>

<p>"You are improving."</p>

<p>A flush of pleasure lighted the boyish face.</p>

<p>"Check," said Andsdell presently. "I had half a
mind to let you win, but you made two wrong moves."</p>

<p>The young man glanced at his watch. "Now I
must go and drill," he exclaimed. "Can we say to-morrow
afternoon again?"</p>

<p>"With pleasure;" smiling readily.</p>

<p>He bowed himself away. Andsdell rose.</p>

<p>"I wonder if I might join your walk? I have met
a Mr. Carrick&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That was my father likely. Grandfather is quite
an old man."</p>

<p>"And figured in the&mdash;what shall we call it&mdash;<i>√©meute</i>?"</p>

<p>Captain Forbes laughed. "That was about it. Yet
at one time I was a good deal afraid there would be a
fierce struggle. Better counsels prevailed, however.
When the army arrived those who had not really dared
to say the government was right so far as obedience
was concerned came out on the right side. A thousand
or so soldiers carried weight," with a half sarcastic
laugh.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span></p>

<p>Andsdell stole furtive glances at the girl the other
side of Forbes. What a graceful, spirited walk she
had; just what one would expect with that well poised
figure.</p>

<p>Then she stopped suddenly and the captain paused
in his talk as she half turned.</p>

<p>"There's father," she exclaimed with a smile that
Andsdell thought enchanting.</p>

<p>He had met the Englishman before and greeted him
politely. After a little talk he slipped his daughter's
arm through his and said mostly to her&mdash;"I am ready
now."</p>

<p>She made her adieu with a kind of nonchalant grace
in which there was not a particle of coquetry. He followed
her with his eyes until they had turned the corner
of the bastion. Then again he saw her as they
were going out.</p>

<p>"I should think that girl would have half the men
in the town at her feet," he said.</p>

<p>"Oh, Miss Carrick?" as if he was not quite certain.
Then with a half smile&mdash;"Do you think so?
Well, she hasn't."</p>

<p>"She is very lovely."</p>

<p>"In a certain way, yes. I believe our people like
more color, more dash and spirit. We are not up on
a very high round, pioneers seldom are. It takes a
generation or so to do the hard work, then comes the
embellishment. They are rather dignified and have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
some French ways. An old grandfather, the fourth
generation back, might have stood for a portrait of the
grand Marquis. It is on the mother's side."</p>

<p>"She doesn't favor the French."</p>

<p>"No, but the boy does, a bright, handsome fellow,
wild as a deer and full of pranks. It will be hard to
tell what race we do favor most. A hundred years
hence we will be going back with a sort of pride,
hunting up ancestors. At present there is too much
to do."</p>

<p>Andsdell went his way presently. He was comfortably
well lodged. He had a bountiful supper and
then he went out for a walk. There was a young
moon over in the west just light enough to bring out
the silvery beech trunks and touch the tips of the
grasses. The woodthrush still gave his long sweet
call at intervals. This path led into the town. He
would not go that way. He wished he knew just
where these Carricks lived. He fancied her sitting
on the porch drinking in the loveliness of the evening.</p>

<p>How absurd! He had seen pretty girls before,
danced with them, flirted with them. There were the
imperious belles of Virginia, who bewitched a man's
fancy in one evening. There were the fair seductive
maids of Philadelphia, and so far he had not been
specially impressed with the girls of this town. A
crowd were coming this way&mdash;he heard the strident
laughter and loud voices, so he stepped aside.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span></p>

<p>Dilly was not sitting out in the fragrant air, but
trying to explain a lesson to Felix. Neither did she
give one thought to the young Englishman. She
was glad in her inmost heart that Ned Langdale had
been engaged elsewhere. Something in his eyes
troubled her. She did not want to make him unhappy.
She hated to be cold and distant to her friend,
yet when she warmed a little he seemed to take so
much for granted that she did not feel inclined to
grant. Why couldn't one be satisfied with friendship?
Occasionally she heard from Archie. They were
eager, ambitious letters and she always read them
aloud.</p>

<p>But if there could come any warmer interest Archie
never would be content with this busy, bustling, working
town, and then they would lose her. Every day
she grew dearer to the mother. Geoffrey Andsdell
decided he did not like the place very well either. He
could not be winning money all the time from the
garrison, and no business opening had been really
thrust upon him, though he felt it was high time he
turned his attention to the fact of making an honest
living. He had wasted four years since he left England.
It would be folly to return, and when that
thought crossed his mind he bit his lip and an ugly
look settled in his eyes. He had come to the New
World to forget all that.</p>

<p>Yes, he would go back to Philadelphia. There were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
genteel opportunities there, and he was not a dullard
if he had not been business bred.</p>

<p>He was asking a little advice of Mrs. Forbes as
they had been sauntering about the hills that were
showing bits of autumnal scenery and scattering the
fragrance of all ripening things on the air. The
jocund song of the birds had settled into a sort of
leisurely sweetness, their summer work was done, nest
building and caring for the young was over with for
the season, and they could review their losses and
gains. Somewhere along the stream that wound in
and out a great frog boomed hoarsely and the younger
ones had lost their fine soprano in trying to emulate
him. Insects of all kinds were shrilling and whirring,
yet underneath it all there was a curious
stillness.</p>

<p>Then a human voice broke on their ear singing a
merry Irish lilt.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's Daffodil Carrick. I could tell her voice
from fifty others. It is never loud but it carries so distinctly.
Let's see where she is."</p>

<p>They turned into the wider path zigzagging through
the woods. Yes, there she sat on the limb of a tree
she had bent down and was gently swaying to and fro.
Her sun-bonnet was held by the strings serving to
drive troublesome insects away. Her golden hair
clustered about her temples in rings and then floated
off by the motion of the swinging, a lovely bewildering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
cloud. She did not notice them at first; then she
sprang up, her face a delicate rosy tint.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mrs. Forbes! And&mdash;Mr. Andsdell!"</p>

<p>She looked a startled woodland nymph. He thought
he had never seen a more lovely picture.</p>

<p>"Are you having a nice time to yourself in your
parlor among the hills? Can't we sit down and share
it with you? I am tired. We have been rambling up
hill and down dale."</p>

<p>A great hollow tree had fallen some time and Mrs.
Forbes seated herself waving her hand to Mr. Andsdell,
who looked a little uncertain.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," Daffodil said. "I have been roaming
around also. It is just the day for it. Now the sun
comes out and tints everything, then it is shade and a
beautiful gray green."</p>

<p>"You were singing," he said, thinking what compliment
would not be too ornate. Out here in the
woods with nature and truth one could not use flattery.</p>

<p>"Yes." She laughed softly a sound that was enchanting.
"When I was little I was a devout believer
in fairies. Grandfather Carrick's second wife came
from Ireland when she was fifteen, and she knew the
most charming stories. You know there are stories
that seem true and hers did. I used to feel sure they
would come and dance in the grass. That was the
song little Eileen sang, and they carried her off, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
they couldn't keep her because she wore a cross that
had been put round her neck when she was christened."</p>

<p>"And did you want to be carried off?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, I think I did. But I had a cross that I made
of beads and named them after the saints. We are
not Catholics, but Huguenots. I took my cross out
in the woods with me, but the fairies never came."</p>

<p>"There is a great deal of really beautiful faith
about those things," said Mrs. Forbes. "And some
of the Indian legends as well. Old Watersee has
stores of them. Some one ought to collect the best
of them. Fairy stories go all over the world, I think,
in different guise. They are the delight of our early
lives. It's sad to lose that childhood faith."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't want to lose it all," Daffodil said
earnestly. "I just say to myself it might have been
true somewhere."</p>

<p>Then they branched off into other matters. The
sky grew grayer and the wind moaned through the
trees, shaking down a cloud of ripe leaves.</p>

<p>"Is it going to rain?" asked Andsdell.</p>

<p>"I think it will storm by to-morrow, but not now.
You see, evening is coming on. We might go down;"
tentatively, not sure she was the one to propose
it.</p>

<p>The path was beautiful, winding in and out, sometimes
over the pile of richest moss, then stirring up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
the fragrance of pennyroyal. But the streets and
houses began to appear.</p>

<p>Barbe Carrick sat on the porch waiting for her
daughter, always feeling a little anxious if she loitered,
though these woods were free from stragglers.
She came to meet them now, she knew Mrs. Forbes
and invited them to rest awhile, and they cheerfully
accepted. Then she went for some cake and grapes
and brought some foaming spruce beer. Even grandmere
came out to meet the guests. Andsdell was delighted
and praised everything and Mrs. Bradin said
with her fine French courtesy&mdash;"You must come
again."</p>

<p>"I shall be most happy to," he replied.</p>

<p>They finished their walk almost in silence. Andsdell
was recalling the many charms of the young girl.
Mrs. Forbes was looking upon him in the light of a
lover. She could understand that the ordinary young
man of the town could not make much headway with
Daffodil Carrick. There were some nice men in the
garrison, but after all&mdash;&mdash;And it was high time Daffodil
had a lover. All women are matchmakers by
instinct and delight in pairing off young folks. She
was a happy wife herself, but she recalled the fact
that the girl was not in love with soldiers.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII<br />
<br />
SPINNING WITH VARIOUS THREADS</h2>

<p>"Richard," Mrs. Forbes began, looking up from the
beaded purse she was knitting, "do you know anything
about that Englishman, Andsdell?"</p>

<p>He had been reading, and smoking his pipe. He
laid down both.</p>

<p>"A sort of goodish, well-informed fellow, who
doesn't drink to excess, and is always a gentleman.
He plays a good deal, and wins oftener than he loses,
but that's luck and knowledge. Like so many young
men, he came over to seek his fortune. He was in
Virginia, was some general's aide, I believe. Why are
you so eager to know his record?"</p>

<p>"Why?" laughing softly. "I think he is very
much smitten with Daffodil Carrick. She is pretty
and sweet, a most admirable daughter, but, somehow,
the beaux do not flock about her. She will make
some one a lovely wife."</p>

<p>"Young Langdale has a fancy for her."</p>

<p>"And she is not at all charmed with military glory.
Her father was a good, brave soldier, and went at
the darkest of times, because his country needed him,
not for fame or enthusiasm. She has heard too much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
of the dangers and struggles. Edward Langdale is
full of soldierly ardor. They have had opportunities
enough to be in love, and she rather shrinks from him.
No, her husband, whoever he is, must be a civilian."</p>

<p>"Why, I think I can learn about him. The Harrisons
are at Williamsburg, you know. And there is a
slight relationship between us. Yes, it would be well
to learn before you dream of wedding rings and all
that."</p>

<p>Still she could not resist asking Daffodil in to tea
to meet some friends. There were Mrs. Trent, the
wife of the first lieutenant, and Bessy Lowy, young
Langdale, and the Englishman. Bessy was a charming,
dark-eyed coquette, ready of wit, and she did admire
Ned. Andsdell was almost a stranger to her,
and in the prettiest, most winsome fashion she relegated
him to Miss Carrick.</p>

<p>They had a gay time, for Mrs. Trent was very
bright and chatty, and her husband had a fund of
small-talk. Afterward they played cards, the amusement
of the times. In two of the games Ned had
Daffodil for a partner, but she was not an enthusiastic
player. And she had accepted Andsdell's escort
home, much to Ned's chagrin.</p>

<p>"I did not know whether you would be at liberty,"
she said simply.</p>

<p>"I'll have an afternoon off Thursday. Will you
go for a walk?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span></p>

<p>She hesitated, and he remarked it.</p>

<p>"I see so little of you now. And you always seem&mdash;different."</p>

<p>"But you know I am quite grown up. We are no
longer children. And that makes a change in every
one."</p>

<p>"But that need not break friendship."</p>

<p>"I think it doesn't break friendship always," she
returned thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Daffodil, you are the loveliest and sweetest girl
I have ever known."</p>

<p>"But not in the whole world," she rejoined archly.</p>

<p>"In my world. That is enough for me. Good-night;"
and he longed to kiss her hand.</p>

<p>She and Andsdell came down from the Fort, crossed
several streets, and then turned to the east. Philadelphia
was their theme of conversation.</p>

<p>"I was such a little girl then," she said, with almost
childish eagerness. "Everything was so different.
I felt as if I was in a palace, and the maid
dressed me with so much care, and went out to walk
with me, and Miss Wharton was so charming. And
now she is in France."</p>

<p>"Would you like to go to France&mdash;Paris?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know. You have been there?"</p>

<p>"Yes, for a short stay."</p>

<p>"And London, and ever so many places?"</p>

<p>"Yes. But I never want to see it again."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span></p>

<p>Something in his tone jarred a little.</p>

<p>"I am glad you like America."</p>

<p>Then they met her father, who was coming for her,
but Mr. Andsdell went on with them to the very
door.</p>

<p>"Did you have a fine time?" asked her mother.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, delightful. Mrs. Trent was so amusing,
and Bessy Lowy was like some one in a play. I wish
my eyes were dark, like yours. I think they are
prettier."</p>

<p>Her mother smiled and kissed her.</p>

<p>All the next morning Dilly sat and spun on the
little wheel, and sang merry snatches from old ballads.
She wished she were not going to walk with
Lieutenant Langdale.</p>

<p>"Is there any wrong in it, mother?" she asked,
turning her perplexed face to Barbe.</p>

<p>"Why, not as I see. You have been friends for so
long. And it is seldom that he gets out now."</p>

<p>The Post brought a letter from Archie. It was
really very joyous. He had won a prize for a fine
treatise, and had joined a club, not for pleasure or
card playing, but debating and improvement of the
mind.</p>

<p>She was very glad they would have this to talk
about. And when Ned saw her joyous face, and had
her gay greeting, his heart gave a great bound. They
went off together in a merry fashion.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, you cannot think"&mdash;then pausing suddenly&mdash;"Did
you have word from Archie in the post?"</p>

<p>"No, but a letter came for mother."</p>

<p>"You hurried me so, or I should have remembered
to bring it. Father thought it so fine. He has won
a prize, twenty-five pounds. And he thinks another
year he may pass all the examinations. Oh, won't
your mother be glad?"</p>

<p>There was such a sweet, joyous satisfaction in her
tone, such a lovely light in her eyes, that his heart
made a protest.</p>

<p>"You care a great deal about his success?" he said
jealously.</p>

<p>"Yes, why not?" in surprise.</p>

<p>"And none about mine?"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;it is so different;" faltering a little. "And
you know I never was overfond of soldiering."</p>

<p>"Where would the country have been but for the
brave men who fought and gained her liberty? Look
at General Washington, and that brave noble-hearted
Lafayette. And there was General Steuben that winter
at Valley Forge, sharing hardship when he might
have lived at ease. It stirs my blood when I think
of the hundreds of brave men, and I am proud to be
a soldier."</p>

<p>He stood up very straight, and there was a world
of resolution in his eyes, a flush on his cheek.</p>

<p>"But you are glad of his success?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span></p>

<p>"And why should you not be as glad of mine?"
not answering her question.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;I am. But you see that appeals to me the
more. Yet I shall be glad for you to rise in your profession,
and win honors, only&mdash;fighting shocks me all
through. I am a coward."</p>

<p>"And he will come back a doctor, and you will rejoice
with him. I shouldn't mind that so much, but
you will marry him&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Marry him! Ned, what are you thinking of!"</p>

<p>There was a curious protest in her face almost
strong enough for horror. Even her lips lost their
rosy tint.</p>

<p>"What I am thinking of is this," and there was a
fierce desperation in his tone. "I love you! love you!
and I cannot bear to think of you going to any other
man, of any person calling you wife. I've always
loved you, and it has grown with my manhood's
strength. Archie will always be lost in his books, and
his care for others. A doctor ought never to marry,
he belongs to the world at large. And I want you
in my very life;" then his arms were about her, and
clasped her so tightly that for an instant she could
make no protest. She pushed away and dropped on
a great stone, beginning to cry.</p>

<p>"Oh, Daffodil, what have I done! It is my wild
love. It is like some plant that grows and grows, and
suddenly bursts into bloom. I almost hated Bessy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
Lowy taking possession of me in that fashion. I
wanted to talk to you, to be near you, to touch your
dear hand. All last night I lay awake thinking of
you. It was so sweet that I did not want to sleep."</p>

<p>"Oh, hush," she entreated, "hush," making as if
she would put him away with her slim hands. "You
must not talk so to me. It is a language I do not
understand, do not like. I think I am not meant for
lovers and marriage. I will be friends always, and
rejoice in your success. And it is the same with
Archie. Oh, let me live my own quiet life with father
and mother&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And never marry?"</p>

<p>"Not for years to come, perhaps never. I am not
afraid of being called an old maid. For Miss Wharton
was delightful and merry, and like a mother to me,
though I shall not be as gay and fond of good times.
I like quiet and my own pretty dreams, and to talk
with the birds and squirrels in the woods, and the
lambs in the fields, and sometimes great-grandfather
comes back."</p>

<p>Her face was partly turned away, and had a rapt
expression. He was walking moodily up and down.
Why was she so different from most girls? And yet
he loved her. She might outgrow this&mdash;was it childishness?</p>

<p>"Well," with a long sigh, "I will wait. If it is
not Archie&mdash;&mdash;"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span></p>

<p>"It is no one. And when some nice girl loves you&mdash;oh,
Ned, you should find some nice sweet girl, who
will be glad of your love. I think girls are when they
meet with the right one. And do not think of me in
that way."</p>

<p>"I shall think of you in that way all the rest of my
life. And if you do not marry, I shall not marry
either."</p>

<p>Then there was a long silence.</p>

<p>"Shall we go on?" she asked timidly.</p>

<p>"The walk is spoiled. It doesn't matter now;"
moodily.</p>

<p>"Oh, Ned, let us be friends again. I cannot bear
to have any one angry with me. No one ever is but
grandad, when we talk about the country or the whiskey
tax," and she laughed, but it was half-heartedly.</p>

<p>What a child she was, after all. For a moment
or two he fancied he did not care so much, but her
sweet face, her lovely eyes, the dainty hands hanging
listlessly at her side, brought him back to his allegiance.</p>

<p>They walked on, but the glory had gone out of the
day, the hope in his heart, the simple gladness of hers.
Then the wind began to blow up chilly, and dark
clouds were drifting about. She shivered.</p>

<p>"Are you cold? Perhaps we had better go back?"</p>

<p>"Well"&mdash;in a sort of resigned tone. Then, after
a pause&mdash;"Are you very angry with me?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span></p>

<p>"Perhaps not angry&mdash;disappointed. I had meant
to have such a nice time."</p>

<p>"I am sorry. If I could have guessed, I would
not have agreed to come."</p>

<p>They paused at the gate. No, he would not come
in. The fine face betrayed disappointment.</p>

<p>"But you will come sometime, when you have quite
forgiven me," and the adorable tenderness in her tone
reawakened hope. After all, Archie was not looking
forward to marriage. Jeffrey Andsdell had not even
entered his mind.</p>

<p>She went in, and threw aside her hat.</p>

<p>"Did you have a nice walk? You came back
soon."</p>

<p>"No, I did not. Ned neither." She went and
stood straight before her mother, pale, yet with a certain
dignity.</p>

<p>"You did not quarrel, I hope. Is it true he is
charmed by Bessy?"</p>

<p>"He asked me to love him. He wants to marry
me;" in a tone that was almost a cry.</p>

<p>"Well?" subjoined her mother. The young lieutenant
was a favorite with her, worth any girl's acceptance,
in her estimation.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't understand about love. To give away
your whole life, years and years;" and she shivered.</p>

<p>"But if you loved him, if you were glad to do it;"
and the mother's tone was encouraging.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah. I think one ought to be glad. And I wasn't
glad when he kissed me." Her face was scarlet now,
her bosom heaving with indignation, her eyes full of
protest.</p>

<p>"He will make a nice husband. His father is devoted
to his mother. He has learned what a true and
tender love really is."</p>

<p>"Mother, would you like me to marry?"</p>

<p>She knelt down at her mother's knee.</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear, not until you love some one;" and
she kissed her fondly.</p>

<p>"Do you think there was ever a girl who could not
love in that way?"</p>

<p>"I should be sorry for her; love is the sweetest
thing in life, the best gift of the good Lord is a good
husband."</p>

<p>Autumn was coming on slowly. Housewives were
making preparations for winter. Daffodil was cheery
and helpful. Grandmere was not as well as usual.
She said she was growing old. There was a great
deal of outside business for the men. Pittsburg was
a borough town, and its citizens were considering various
industries. Every day almost, new things came
to the fore, and now they were trying some experiments
in making glass. The country round was rich
in minerals. Boat-building required larger accommodations.
The post road had been improved, straightened,
the distance shortened. There were sundry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
alterations in looms, and homespun cloth was made
of a better quality.</p>

<p>Daffodil Carrick watched some of the lovers, who
came under her notice. She met Lieutenant Langdale
occasionally, and they were outwardly friends.
They even danced together, but her very frankness
and honesty kept up the barrier between them. He
tried to make her jealous, but it never quickened a
pulse within her.</p>

<p>Yet in a curious way she was speculating on the
master passion. There were not many books to distract
her attention, but one day there came a package
from her guardian that contained a few of the old
rather stilted novels, and some volumes of poems by
the older English poets, dainty little songs that her
mother sung, and love verses to this one or that one,
names as odd as hers. And how they seemed to love
Daisies and Daffodils.</p>

<p>She took them out with her on her walks, and read
them aloud to the woods, and the birds, or sometimes
sang them. Jeffrey Andsdell found a wood nymph
one day and listened. He had met her twice since the
evening at Mrs. Forbes'. And he wondered now
whether he should surprise her or go his way.</p>

<p>She rose presently, and by a sudden turn surprised
him.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," he said. "I have been listening,
enchanted. First I could not imagine whether
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
it was some wandering fay or wood nymph
wild."</p>

<p>"Oh, do I look very wild?" with a most charming
smile.</p>

<p>"Why"&mdash;he colored a little&mdash;"perhaps the word
may have more than one meaning. Oh, you look as
if you were part of the forest, a sprite or fairy being."</p>

<p>"Oh, do you believe in them? I sit here sometimes
and call them up. There was an odd volume
sent me awhile ago, a play by Shakespere, 'Midsummer
Night's Dream,' and it is full of those little
mischievous elves and dainty darlings."</p>

<p>"That is not it?" coming nearer and looking at
her book.</p>

<p>"Oh, it is verses by one Mr. Herrick. Some of
them almost sing themselves, and I put tunes to
them."</p>

<p>"And sing to the woods and waters. You should
have a more appreciative audience."</p>

<p>"Oh, I couldn't sing to real people," and she
flushed. "I wonder if"&mdash;and there came a far-away
look in her eyes that passed him, and yet he
saw it.</p>

<p>"What is the wonder?"</p>

<p>"That if you could write verses, songs."</p>

<p>She asked it in all simplicity.</p>

<p>"No, I couldn't;" in the frankest of tones.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span></p>

<p>"One must know a good deal."</p>

<p>"And be a genius beside."</p>

<p>"What queer names they give the girls. Chloe,
that isn't a bit pretty, and Phyllis, that is a slave name.
And Lesbia, that isn't so bad."</p>

<p>"I think I have found Daffodil among them. And
that is beautiful."</p>

<p>"Do you think so?" She could not tell why she
was glad, but he saw it in her face, and what a sweet
face it was! He wondered then how such a fascinating
bit of sweetness and innocence could have kept its
charm in this rather rough soil. Her frankness was
fascinating.</p>

<p>"Do you come here often?" he asked presently.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, in the summer."</p>

<p>"That was when I first met you. I was with Mrs.
Forbes. And her little tea was very nice and social.
I've not seen you since. Don't you go to the Fort
only on special invitation? There are quite a number
of visitors. Strangers always come."</p>

<p>"I am quite busy," she replied. "Grandmere has
not been well, and I help mother. There is a great
deal to do in the fall."</p>

<p>Such a pretty housewifely look settled in her face.
How lovely it was, with the purity of girlhood.</p>

<p>The wind swayed the wooded expanse, and sent
showers of scarlet and golden maple leaves down
upon them. The hickory was a blaze of yellow, some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
oaks were turning coppery. Acorns fell now and
then, squirrels ran about and disputed over them. He
reached over and took her book, seating himself on
the fallen log, and began reading to her. The sound
of his voice and the melody of the poems took her
into another land, the land of her fancy. If one could
live in it always! The sun dropped down, and it
seemed evening, though it was more the darkness of
the woods.</p>

<p>She rose. They walked down together, there was
no third person, and he helped her with the gentlest
touch over some hillocks made by the rain-washed
roots of the trees. Then she slipped on some dead
pine needles, and his arm was around her for several
paces, and quietly withdrawn.</p>

<p>Daffodil laughed and raised her face to his.</p>

<p>"Once I slipped this way, it was over on the other
path, where it is steeper, and slid down some distance,
but caught a tree and saved myself, for there was a
big rock I was afraid I should hit. And I was pretty
well scratched. Now I catch the first thing handy.
That rock is a splendid big thing. You ought to
see it."</p>

<p>"You must pilot me some day."</p>

<p>They emerged into the light. The rivers were still
gleaming with the sunset fire, but over eastward it was
twilight gray.</p>

<p>"Good-night;" as they reached her house. "I am
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
glad I found you there in the woods. I have had a
most enjoyable time."</p>

<p>"Good-night," she said in return.</p>

<p>A neighbor was sitting by the candle her mother
had just lighted.</p>

<p>"Dilly, you come over here and write these recipes.
My eyes ain't what they used to be. And your mother
does make some of that peppery sauce that my man
thinks the best in Pittsburg. And that grape jam is
hard to beat. Your fingers are young and spry, they
hain't washed, and scrubbed, and kneaded bread, 'n'
all that for forty year."</p>

<p>Daffodil complied readily. Mrs. Carrick told the
processes as well.</p>

<p>"For there's so much in the doin'," said Mrs. Moss.
"That's the real luck of it."</p>

<p>Felix went down to the shipyard after school, and
came home with his father. To go to New Orleans
now was his great aim.</p>

<p>"Grandad wants you to come over there," Mrs.
Carrick said to her daughter.</p>

<p>"Then I'll have to read my paper myself," Mr.
Carrick complained.</p>

<p>Grandad wanted her to go over some papers. They
were all right, he knew, but two heads were better
than one, if one was a pin's head. Then she must
gossip awhile with Norah, while grandad leaned back
in his chair and snored. Her father came for her,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
and she went to bed to the music of the dainty poems
read in an impressive voice.</p>

<p>And when she awoke in the morning there seemed
a strange music surging in her ears, and in her heart,
and she listened to it like one entranced. But she
had gone past the days of fairy lore, she was no longer
a little girl to build wonderful magic haunts, and people
them. Yet what was it, this new anticipation of
something to come that would exceed all that had
gone before?</p>

<p>It came on to rain at noon, a sort of sullen autumn
storm, with not much wind at first, but it would gain
power at nightfall. Daffodil and her mother were sewing
on some clothes for the boy, women had learned
to make almost everything. It took time, too. There
were no magic sewing machines. Grandmere was
spinning on the big wheel the other side of the room,
running to and fro, and pulling out the wool into yarn.</p>

<p>"Why so grave, child? Is it a thought of pity for
the lieutenant?" and Mrs. Carrick gave a faint smile
that would have invited confidence if there had been
any to give. She could hardly relinquish the idea that
her daughter might relent.</p>

<p>"Oh, no. One can hardly fix the fleeting thoughts
that wander idly through one's brain. The loneliness
of the woods when the squirrels hide in their holes,
and no bird voices make merry. And bits of verses
and remembrance of half-forgotten things. Is any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
one's mind altogether set upon work? There are two
lives going on within us."</p>

<p>Barbe Carrick had never lived but the one life, except
when her husband was with the army, and she
was glad enough to lay down the other. Had it been
wise for Daffodil to spend those months in Philadelphia?
Yet she had accepted her old home cheerfully.
And all unconsciously she had worked changes in it
to her grandmother's delight. Now her father was
prospering. They would be among the "best people"
as time went on.</p>

<p>The storm lasted three days. There had been some
hours of wild fury in it, when the trees groaned and
split, and the rivers lashed themselves into fury. Then
it cleared up with a soft May air, and some things
took a second growth. There was a sort of wild
pear tree at the corner of the garden, and it budded.</p>

<p>Daffodil did not take her accustomed walk up in
the woods. Something held her back, but she would
not allow to herself it was that. Instead, she took
rides on Dolly in different directions. One day she
went down to the shipyard with a message for her
father. Mr. Andsdell stood talking with him. Her
pulses suddenly quickened.</p>

<p>"Well, you've started at the right end," Bernard
Carrick was saying. "This place has a big future
before it. If it was a good place for a fort, it's a
splendid place for a town. Philadelphia can't hold a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
candle to it, if she did have more than a hundred years
the start. Why they should have gone way up the
Delaware River beats me. Yes, come up to the house,
and we'll talk it over."</p>

<p>Then they both turned to the young girl. There
was a pleasurable light in Andsdell's eyes.</p>

<p>Afterward he walked some distance beside her horse.
The storm, the beautiful weather since, the busy aspect
of the town, the nothings that are so convenient when
it is best to leave some things in abeyance. Then he
said adieu and turned to his own street, where he had
lodgings.</p>

<p>She went on with a curiously light heart. Her
father had said, "Come up to the house," and she was
glad she had not gone to the woods in the hope of
meeting him.</p>

<p>She slipped off Dolly and ran to the garden.
"Oh, Norry, what are you doing?" she cried with a
sound of anger in her voice. "My beautiful pear
blossoms! I've been watching them every day."</p>

<p>They lay on the ground. Norry even sprang up
for the last one.</p>

<p>"They're bad luck, child! Blossoms or fruit out
of season is trouble without reason. I hadn't spied
them before, or I wouldn't have let them come to light.
That's as true as true can be. There, don't cry, child.
I hope I haven't been too late."</p>

<p>"Yes. I've heard the adage," said her mother.
"Norry is superstitious."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII<br />
<br />
THE SWEETNESS OF LOVE</h2>

<p>"Still, I'm glad you inquired," Mrs. Forbes said
to her husband. "And that there's nothing derogatory
to the young man. He's likely now to settle
down, and he will have a fine chance with Mr. Carrick,
who certainly is taking fortune at the flood tide.
And one can guess what will happen."</p>

<p>"A woman generally guesses that. I hoped it
would be Langdale. He is a fine fellow, and will
make his mark," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Daffodil isn't in love with military life. Most
girls are;" laughing. "Why, I never had two
thoughts about the matter. I must give them a little
tea again."</p>

<p>"Ask Jack Remsen and Peggy Ray, and make them
happy, but leave out the lieutenant. Something surely
happened between them."</p>

<p>Andsdell came to the Carricks according to agreement.
How cosy the place looked, with the great
blaze of the logs in the fireplace, that shed a radiance
around. He was formally presented to Mrs. Carrick
and the Bradins. Daffodil and her mother sat in the
far corner, with two candles burning on the light
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
stand. The girl was knitting some fine thread stockings,
with a new pattern of clocks, that Jane had
sent her from Philadelphia. Felix had a cold, and
had gone to bed immediately after supper, and they
were all relieved at that.</p>

<p>Jeffrey Andsdell had stated his case. He was tired
of desultory wandering, and seven-and-twenty was
high time to take up some life work. He was the
fourth son of a titled family, with no especial longing
for the army or the church, therefore he, like other
young men without prospects, had emigrated. The
heir to the title and estates, the elder brother, was
married and had two sons, the next one was married
also, but so far had only girls, and the entail was in
the male line. The brother next older than Jeffrey had
been a sort of imbecile, and died. But there was no
chance of his succeeding, so he must make his own
way. He had spent two years at Richmond and
Williamsburg, then at Philadelphia. At Williamsburg
he had taken quite a fancy to the stage, and
achieved some success, but the company had disbanded.
It was a rather precarious profession at
best, though he had tried a little of it in London.</p>

<p>The straightforward story tallied with Captain
Forbes' information. True, there was one episode
he had not dwelt upon, it would never come up in
this new life. How he had been crazy enough to take
such a step he could not now imagine. But it was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
over, and done with, and henceforward life should
be an honorable success.</p>

<p>Daffodil listened between counting her stitches.
She stole shy glances now and then, he sat so the firelight
threw up his face in strong relief. The brown
hair had a little tumbled look, the remnant of some
boyish curls. The features were good, rather of the
aquiline order, the eyes well opened, of a sort of
nondescript hazel, the brown beard worn in the pointed
style, with a very narrow moustache, for the upper
lip was short and the smiling aspect not quite
hidden.</p>

<p>When he rose to go the ladies rose also. He shook
hands, and held Daffodil's a moment with a pressure
that brought a faint color to her soft cheek.</p>

<p>"He is very much of a gentleman," commented
Mrs. Bradin. "And, taking up a steady occupation
is greatly to his credit. Though it seems as if a
soldier's life would have been more to his taste."</p>

<p>"I am glad he did not fight against us," said Barbe.</p>

<p>"Some have, and have repented," added her husband,
with a touch of humor in his tone. "And we
are large-minded enough to forgive them."</p>

<p>Daffodil did not see him until she went over to the
Fort. Langdale dropped in to see her, but there was
no cordial invitation to remain. He knew later on
that Andsdell was there, and in his heart he felt it
was not Archie who would be his strongest rival. If
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
there was something that could be unearthed against
the Englishman!</p>

<p>The Remsens, mother and son, were very agreeable
people, quite singers, but there was no piano for
accompaniment, though there were flutes and violins
at the Fort. Andsdell, after some pressing, sang also,
and his voice showed training. Then he repeated a
scene from "The Tempest" that enchanted his hearers.
Daffodil was curiously proud of him.</p>

<p>"You did not haunt the woods much," he began
on the way home. "I looked for you."</p>

<p>"Did you?" Her heart beat with delicious pleasure.
"But I did not promise to come."</p>

<p>"No. But I looked all the same, day after day.
What were you so busy about?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know. I thought&mdash;that perhaps it
wasn't quite&mdash;right;" hesitatingly.</p>

<p>"It will be right now." He pressed the arm closer
that had been slipped in his. Then they were silent,
but both understood. There was something so sweet
and true about her, so delicate, yet wise, that needed
no blurting out of any fact, for both to take it into
their lives.</p>

<p>"And who was there to-night?" asked her mother,
with a little fear. For Mrs. Forbes would hardly
know how matters stood between her and Lieutenant
Langdale.</p>

<p>"The Remsens only. And they sing beautifully together.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
Oh, it was really charming. Mrs. Remsen
asked me to visit her. It's odd, mother, but do you
know my friends have mostly fallen out! So many
of the girls have married, and I seem older than the
others. Does a year or two change one so? I sometimes
wonder if I was the eager little girl who went
to Philadelphia, and to whom everything was a delight."</p>

<p>"You are no longer a little girl."</p>

<p>"And at the nutting the other day, I went to please
Felix, you know. But the boys seemed so rough.
And though I climbed a tree when they all insisted, I&mdash;I
was ashamed;" and her face was scarlet.</p>

<p>Yes, the Little Girl was gone forever.</p>

<p>Her mother kissed her, and she felt now that her
child would need no one to tell her what love was
like. For it took root in one's heart, and sprang up
to its hallowed blooming.</p>

<p>It was too soon for confidences. Dilly did not
know that she had any that could be put into words.
Only the world looked beautiful and bright, as if it
was spring, instead of winter.</p>

<p>"You've changed again," Felix said observantly.
"You're very sweet, Dilly. Maybe as girls grow
older they grow sweeter. I shan't mind your being
an old maid if you stay like this. Dilly, didn't you ever
have a beau? It seems to me no one has come&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, you silly child!" She laughed and blushed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span></p>

<p>There were sleighing parties and dances. It is odd
that in some communities a girl is so soon dropped
out. The dancing parties, rather rough frolics they
were, took in the girls from twelve to sixteen, and
each one strove boldly for a beau. She was not going
to be left behind in the running. But Daffodil
Carrick was already left behind, they thought, though
she was asked to the big houses, and the dinners, and
teas at the Fort.</p>

<p>Andsdell dropped in now and then ostensibly to
consult Mr. Carrick. Then he was invited to tea on
Sunday night, and to dinner at the holidays, when he
summoned courage to ask Bernard Carrick for his
daughter.</p>

<p>For he had begun a new life truly. The past was
buried, and never would be exhumed. And why
should a man's whole life be blighted by a moment of
folly!</p>

<p>They grew brave enough to look at one another in
the glowing firelight, even if the family were about.
One evening she stepped out in the moonlight with
him. There was a soft snow on the ground, and
some of the branches were yet jewelled with it. Half
the lovers in the town would have caught a handful
of it and rubbed crimson roses on her cheeks. He
said, "Daffodil," and drew her closely in his arms,
kissed the lips that throbbed with bashful joy and
tremulous sweetness.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span></p>

<p>"Dear, I love you. And you&mdash;you are mine."</p>

<p>There was a long delicious breath. The story of
love is easily told when both understand the divine
language.</p>

<p>She came in glowing, with eyes like stars, and went
straight to her mother, who was sitting alone. Both
of the men had gone to some borough business. She
kissed her joyous secret into the waiting heart.</p>

<p>"You love him. You know now what love is?
That is the way I loved your father."</p>

<p>"It is wonderful, isn't it? You grow into it, hardly
knowing, and then it is told without words, though
the words come afterward. Oh, did you think&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Foolish child, we all saw. He carried the story
in his eyes. Your father knew. He has been very
honest and upright. Oh, my dear, I am so glad for
you. Marriage is the crown of womanhood."</p>

<p>Her mother drew her down in her lap. Daffodil's
arms were around her neck, and they were heart to
heart, a happy mother and a happy child.</p>

<p>"You will not mind if I go to bed? I&mdash;I want to
be alone."</p>

<p>"No, dear. Happy dreams, whether you wake or
sleep."</p>

<p>She lay in a delicious tremor. There was a radiant
light all about her, though the room was dark. This
was what it was to be loved and to love, and she could
not tell which was best.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span></p>

<p>Then at home he was her acknowledged lover. He
came on Wednesday night and Sunday to tea. But
Norry soon found it out, and was glad for her.
Grandad teased her a little.</p>

<p>"And you needn't think I'm going to leave you
any fortune," he said, almost grumblingly. "The
blamed whiskey tax is eating it up every year, and the
little left will go to Felix. You have all that land
over there that you don't need more than a dog needs
two tails. Well, I think there are times when a dog
would be glad to wag both, if he had 'em. That will
be enough for you and your children. But I'll dance
at the wedding."</p>

<p>Barbe Carrick looked over the chest of treasures
that she had been adding to year after year. There
was <i>her</i> wedding gown, and it had been her mother's
before her. The lace was exquisite, and no one could
do such needlework nowadays. What if it had grown
creamy by age, that only enhanced it.</p>

<p>Here were the other things she had accumulated,
sometimes with a pang lest they should not be needed.
Laid away in rose leaves and lavender blooms. Oh,
how daintily sweet they were, but not sweeter than the
girl who was to have them. And here were some
jewels that had been great-grandmother Duvernay's.
She would have no mean outfit to hand down again
to posterity.</p>

<p>Barbe was doubly glad that she would live here.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
She could not bear the thought of her going away,
and a soldier's wife was never quite sure where he
might be called, or into what danger. There would
be a nice home not very far away, there would be
sweet, dainty grandchildren. It was worth waiting
for.</p>

<p>Jeffrey Andsdell was minded not to wait very long.
Love was growing by what it fed upon, but he
wanted the feast daily. They could stay at home until
their new house was built.</p>

<p>"We ought to go over across the river," she said,
"and be pioneers in the wilderness. And, oh, there
is one thing that perhaps you won't like. Whoever
married me was to take the name of Duvernay, go
back to the French line."</p>

<p>"Why, yes, I like that immensely." That would
sever the last link. He would be free of all the old
life.</p>

<p>"It isn't as pretty as yours."</p>

<p>"Oh, do you think so? Now, I am of the other
opinion;" laughing into her lovely eyes.</p>

<p>She grew sweeter day by day, even her mother
could see that. Yes, love was the atmosphere in
which a woman throve.</p>

<p>Barbe settled the wedding time. "When the Daffodils
are in bloom," she said, and the lover agreed.</p>

<p>Archie Langdale wrote her a brotherly letter, but
said, "If you could put it off until my vacation. I'm
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
coming back to take another year, there have been
so many new discoveries, and I want to get to the
very top. Dilly&mdash;that was the child's name, I used
to have a little dream about you. You know I was a
dull sort of fellow, always stuffing my head with
books, and you were sweet and never flouted me. I
loved you very much. I thought you would marry
Ned, and then you would be my sister, you could understand
things that other girls didn't. I am quite
sure he loved you, too. But your happiness is the first
thing to be considered, and I hope you will be very
happy."</p>

<p>The engagement was suspected before it was really
admitted. There were various comments, of course.
Daffodil Carrick had been waiting for something fine,
and she could afford to marry a poor man with her
possible fortune, and her father's prosperity. And
some day a girl would be in luck to get young Sandy
Carrick.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Langdale took it pretty hard. He had
somehow hoped against hope, for he believed the Carricks
would refuse a man who had come a stranger
in the place. If he could call him out and shoot him
down in a duel! He shut himself up in his room, and
drank madly for two days before he came to his
senses.</p>

<p>March came in like the lion and then dropped
down with radiant suns that set all nature aglow.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
There were freshets, but they did little damage.
Trees budded and birds came and built in the
branches. Bees flew out in the sunshine, squirrels
chattered, and the whole world was gay and glad.</p>

<p>One day the lovers went up the winding path to
the old hill-top, where Jeffrey insisted he had first
lost his heart to her. They sat on the same tree trunk,
and he said verses to her, but instead of Clorinda it
was Daffodil. And they talked sweet nonsense, such
as never goes out of date between lovers. And
when they came down they looked at the daffodil
bed. The buds had swollen, some were showing
yellow.</p>

<p>"Why, it can be next week!" cried the lover joyously.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the mother, with limpid eyes, remembering
when the child was born.</p>

<p>There was not much to make ready. The cake
had been laid away to season, so that it would cut
nicely. There was a pretty new church now, and the
marriage would be solemnized there, with a wedding
feast at home, and then a round of parties for several
evenings at different houses. The Trents had just
finished their house, which was considered quite a
mansion, and the carpets had come from France.
They would give the first entertainment.</p>

<p>She had written to her guardian, who sent her a
kindly letter, wishing her all happiness. The winter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
had been a rather hard one for him, for an old enemy
that had been held in abeyance for several years,
rheumatism, had returned, and though it was routed
now, it had left him rather enfeebled, otherwise he
would have taken the journey to see his ward, the
little girl grown up, whose visit he had enjoyed so
much, and whom he hoped to welcome in his home
some time again.</p>

<p>And with it came a beautiful watch and chain.
Presents were not much in vogue in those days, and
their rarity made them all the more precious.</p>

<p>They dressed the house with daffodils, but the
bride-to-be was all in white, the veil the great-grandmother
had worn in Paris, fastened with a diamond
circlet just as she had had it.</p>

<p>"Oh!" Daffodil exclaimed, "if great-grandfather
could see me!"</p>

<p>Jeffrey Andsdell took her in his arms and kissed
her. This was, indeed, a true marriage, and could
there ever be a sweeter bride?</p>

<p>She was smiling and happy, for every one was
pleased, so why should she not be! She even forgot
the young man pacing about the Fort wishing&mdash;ah,
what could he wish except that he was in Andsdell's
place? For surely he was not mean enough to grudge
<i>her</i> any happiness.</p>

<p>She walked up the church aisle on her lover's arm
and next came her parents. Once Andsdell's lips
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
compressed themselves, and a strange pallor and shudder
came over him.</p>

<p>Her father gave her away. The clergyman pronounced
them man and wife. Then friends thronged
around. They were privileged to kiss the bride in
those days.</p>

<p>"My wife," was what Jeffrey Andsdell said in a
breathless, quivering tone.</p>

<p>They could not rush out in modern fashion. She
cast her smiles on every side, she was so happy and
light-hearted.</p>

<p>They reached the porch just as a coach drove up
at furious speed. A woman sprang out, a tall, imperious-looking
person, dressed in grand style. Her
cheeks were painted, her black eyes snapped defiance.
One and another fell back and stared as she
cried in an imperious tone, looking fiercely at the
bride, "Am I too late? Have you married him?
But you cannot be his wife. I am his lawful, legal
wife, and the mother of his son, who is the future
heir of Hurst Abbey. I have come from England to
claim him. His father, the Earl of Wrexham, sends
for him, to have him restored to his ancestral home."</p>

<p>She had uttered this almost in a breath. Daffodil,
with the utmost incredulity, turned to her husband
and smiled, but the lines almost froze in her face.
For his was deadly white and his eyes were fixed on
the woman with absolute terror.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span></p>

<p>"It is God's own truth," she continued. "I have
your father's letter, and you will hardly disown his
signature. Your son is at Hurst Abbey&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Woman!" he thundered, "it is a base trumped-up
lie! There are four lives between me and the
succession, and there may be more."</p>

<p>"There <i>were</i>, but last autumn they were all swept
suddenly out of existence. The Earl was crazed with
grief. I went to him and took his grandson, a beautiful
child, that would appeal to any heart. And at
his desire I have come to America for you."</p>

<p>Jeffrey Andsdell placed his wife in her father's
arms. "Take her home," he said hoarsely, "I
will follow and disprove this wild, baseless
tale."</p>

<p>Then he pressed her to his heart. "Whatever happens,
you are the only woman I have ever loved, remember
that;" and taking the woman's arm, entered
her coach with her.</p>

<p>The small group dispersed without a word. What
could be said! There was consternation on all faces.
Bernard Carrick took his daughter home. Once her
mother kissed the pallid cheek, and essayed some word
of comfort.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't!" she cried piteously. "Let me be
still. I must wait and bear it until&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She did not cry or faint, but seemed turning to
stone. And when they reached the house she went
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
straight through the room where the feast was spread,
to her own, and threw herself on the bed.</p>

<p>"Oh, acushla darlin'," cried Norah, "sure we had
the warning when the pear tree bloomed. I said it
was trouble without reason, and though I broke them
all off it couldn't save you."</p>

<p>"Oh, my darlin', God help us all."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV<br />
<br />
SORROW'S CROWN OF SORROW</h2>

<p>"Whatever happens!" The words rang through
Daffodil's brain like a knell. There was something
to happen. She had been so happy, so serenely, so
trustingly happy. For her youthful inexperience had
not taught her doubt. The cup of love had been held
to her lips and she had drank the divine draught fearlessly,
with no thought of bitter dregs at the bottom.</p>

<p>Grandmere came and unpinned the veil; it was too
fine and precious an article to be tumbled about.</p>

<p>"Let the rest be," she said. "He is coming and I
want to be as I was then."</p>

<p>Then they left her lying there on the bed, the
gold of her young life turning slowly to dross. Some
curious prescience told her how it would be.</p>

<p>She heard the low voices in the other room. There
was crying too. That was her mother. Felix asked
questions and was hushed. Was it hours or half a
lifetime! All in her brain was chaos, the chaos of
belief striving with disbelief that was somehow
illumined but not with hope.</p>

<p>He came at last. She heard his step striding
through the room and no one seemed to speak to him.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
He came straight to her, knelt at the bed's side, and
took her cold hands in his that were at fever heat.</p>

<p>"My poor darling!" he said brokenly. "I should
not have learned to love you so well, I should not have
asked for your love. But in this new country and
beginning a new life it seemed as if I might bury the
old past. And you were the centre, the star of the
new. Perhaps if I had told you the story&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tell it now," she made answer, but it did not
sound like her voice. She made no effort to release
her hands though his seemed to scorch them.</p>

<p>"You can hardly understand that old life in London.
There is nothing like it here. I was with a lot of gay
companions, and all we thought of was amusement. I
had a gift for acting and was persuaded to take part
in a play. It was a success. I was flattered and f√™ted.
Women made much of me. I was only a boy after
all. And the leading lady, some seven years my
senior, fascinated me by her attention and her flatteries.
It did turn my head. I was her devoted admirer,
yet it was not the sort of love that a man
knows later on. How it came about, why she should
have done such a thing I cannot divine even now, for
at that time I was only a poor, younger son, loaded
with debts, though most of my compeers were in the
same case. But she married me with really nothing
to gain. She kept to the stage. I was tired of it and
gave it up, which led to our first dissension. She fancied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
she saw in me some of the qualities that might
make a name. And then&mdash;she was angry about the
child. We bickered continually. She was very fond
of admiration and men went down to her. After a
little I ceased to be jealous. I suppose it was because
I ceased to care and could only think of the wretched
blunder I had made and how I could undo it. We
had kept the marriage a secret except from her aunt
and a few friends. She would have it so. The child
was put out to nurse and the company was going to
try their fortunes elsewhere. I would not go with
her. In a certain way I had been useful to her and
we had a little scene. I went to my father and asked
him for money enough to take me to America, where I
could cut loose from old associates and begin a new
life. He did more. He paid my debts, but told me
that henceforward I must look out for myself as this
was the last he should do for me."</p>

<p>"And now he asks you to return?" There was a
certainty in her voice and she was as unemotional as
if they were talking of some one else.</p>

<p>"It is true that now I am his only living son. Late
last autumn Lord Veron, his wife and two sons, with
my next brother, Archibald, were out for an afternoon's
pleasure in a sailboat when there came up an
awful blow and a sudden dash of rain. They were
about in the middle of the lake. The wind twisted
them around, the mast snapped, they found afterward
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
that it was not seaworthy. There was no help at
hand. They battled for awhile, then the boat turned
over. Lady Veron never rose, the others swam for
some time, but Archibald was the only one who came
in to shore and he was so spent that he died two days
later. I wonder the awful blow did not kill poor
father. He was ill for a long while. My wife went
to him then and took the child and had sufficient proof
to establish the fact of the marriage, and her aunt
had always been a foster mother to the boy. There
must be some curious fascination about her, though
I do not wonder father felt drawn to his only remaining
son. Archibald's two children are girls and so are
not in the entail. Hurst Abbey would go to some
distant cousins. And she offered to come to America
and find me. She has succeeded," he ended
bitterly.</p>

<p>There was a long pause. He raised his head, but
her face was turned away. Did she really care for
him? She was taking it all so calmly.</p>

<p>"You will go," she said presently.</p>

<p>"Oh, how can I leave you? For now I know what
real love is like. And this is a new country. I have
begun a new life, Daffodil&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But I cannot be your wife, you see that. Would
you give up your father's love, the position awaiting
you for a tie that could never be sanctified? You must
return."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span></p>

<p>"There is my son, you know. I shall not matter
so much to them. It shall be as you say, my darling.
And we need not stay here. It is a big and prospering
country and I know now that I can make my
way&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>It was not the tone of ardent desire. How she could
tell she did not know, but the words dropped on her
heart like a knell. Apart from the sacrifice he
seemed ready to make for her there was the cruel
fact that would mar her whole life, and an intangible
knowledge that he would regret it.</p>

<p>"You must go." Her voice was firm.</p>

<p>Did she love so deeply? He expected passionate upbraiding
and then despairing love, clinging tenderness.
One moment he was wild to have the frank,
innocent sweetness of their courtship; he was minded
to take her in his arms and press bewildering kisses
on the sweet mouth, the fair brow, the delicately
tinted cheek, as if he could not give her up. Then
Hurst Abbey rose before him, his father bowed with
the weight of sorrow ready to welcome him, the fine
position he could fill, and after all would the wife
be such a drawback? There were many marriages
without overwhelming love. If his father accepted
her&mdash;and from his letter he seemed to unreservedly.</p>

<p>He rose from his kneeling posture and leaned over
her. She looked in her quaint wedding dress and
marble paleness as if it was death rather than life.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span></p>

<p>"You can never forgive me." His voice was broken
with emotion, though he did not realize all the havoc
he had made. "But I shall dream of you and go on
loving&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No! no!" raising her hand. "We must both forget.
You have other duties and I must rouse myself
and overlive the vision of a life that would have been
complete, perhaps too exquisite for daily wear. It
may all be a dream, a youthful fancy. Others have
had it vanish after marriage. Now, go."</p>

<p>He bent over to kiss her. She put up her hand.</p>

<p>Was it really more anger than love?</p>

<p>"I wish you all success for your poor father's
sake." She was going to add&mdash;"And try to love
your wife," but her whole soul protested.</p>

<p>He went slowly out of the room. She did not turn
or make the slightest motion. She heard the low
sound of voices in the other room, his among them,
and then all was silence. He had gone away out of
her life.</p>

<p>Her mother entered quietly, came near, and took her
in her arms.</p>

<p>"Oh, my darling, how could the good All Father,
who cares for his children, let such a cruel thing
happen? If that woman had come a month ago! And
he fancied being here, marrying, never to go back,
made him in a sense free. But he should not have
hidden the fact. I can never forgive him. Yet one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
feels sorry as well that he should have misspent so
much of his life."</p>

<p>"Help me take off my gown, mother. No one must
ever wear it again. And we will try not to talk it over,
but put it out of our minds. I am very tired. You
won't mind if I lie here and see no one except you
who are so dear to me."</p>

<p>It was too soon for any comfort, that the mother
felt as she moved about with lightest tread. Then
she kissed her and left her to her sorrow.</p>

<p>Mr. Carrick had been very much incensed and
blamed the suitor severely. Andsdell had taken it
with such real concern and regret and apparent heart-break
that the father felt some lenity might be allowed
in thought, at least.</p>

<p>Grandad was very bitter and thought condign punishment
should overtake him.</p>

<p>"And instead," said warm-hearted Norah indignantly,
"he turns into a great lord and has everything
to his hand. I could wish his wife was ten times worse
and I hope she'll lead him such a life that he'll never
see a happy day nor hour, the mean, despicable
wretch."</p>

<p>In the night tears came to Daffodil's relief, yet she
felt the exposure had come none too soon. With her
sorrow there was a sense of deception to counteract it.
He had not been honest in spite of apparent frankness,
and it hurt her to think he had accepted her verdict
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
so readily. Hard as it would have been to combat his
protestations in her moment of longing and despair,
any woman would rather have remembered them afterward.</p>

<p>Daffodil kept her bed for several days. She felt
weak and distraught. Yet she had her own consciousness
of rectitude. She had not been so easily won, and
she had been firm and upright at the last. There was
no weak kiss of longing to remember. The one he had
given her in the church could be recalled without
shame. For a few moments she had been in a trance
of happiness as his wife. And putting him away she
must also bury out of sight all that had gone before.</p>

<p>She took her olden place in the household, she went
to church after a week or two and began to see friends
again, who all seemed to stand in a little awe of her.
The weather was lovely. She was out in the garden
with her mother. She rode about with her father.
But she felt as if years had passed over her and she
was no longer the lightsome girl.</p>

<p>It made her smile too, to think how everything else
was changing. The old log houses were disappearing.
Alleyways were transformed into streets and
quite noteworthy residences were going up. General
O'Hara and Mayor Craig enlarged their glass house
and improved the quality of glass. She remembered
when her father had tacked some fine cloth over the
window-casing and oiled it to give it a sort of transparency
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
so that they could have a little light until it
was cold enough to shut the wooden shutters all the
time, for glass was so dear it could not be put in all
the windows. Not that it was cheap now, the processes
were cumbersome and slow, but most of the
material was at hand.</p>

<p>Mrs. Forbes was a warm and trusty friend through
this time of sorrow. She would not let Daffodil blame
herself.</p>

<p>"We all liked Mr. Andsdell very much, I am sure.
I can count up half a dozen girls who were eager
enough to meet him and who were sending him invitations.
He really was superior to most of our young
men in the way of education and manners. And, my
dear, I rather picked him out for you, and when I saw
he was attracted I made the captain write to a friend of
his at Williamsburg and learn if there was anything
serious against him, and everything came back in his
favor. Of course none of us suspected a marriage.
He talked frankly about his family when there was
need, but not in any boastful way. And this is not as
disgraceful as some young men who have really had
to leave their country for their country's good. But,
my dear, if it had not been for this horrid marriage
you would have gone off in style and been my lady."</p>

<p>"But maybe none of it would have happened then;"
with a rather wan smile.</p>

<p>"True enough! But you're not going to settle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
down in sober ways and wear hodden gray. And it's
not as if you had been jilted by some gay gallant who
had married another girl before your eyes as Christy
Speers' lover did. And she found a much better man
without any long waiting, for Everlom has never succeeded
in anything and now he has taken to drink.
Don't you suppose Christy is glad she missed her
chance with him!"</p>

<p>"It won't be that way, though. I think now he
will make a fine man and we shall hear nothing disgraceful
about him, if we ever hear at all, which I
pray may never come to pass. For I want to put it
out of my mind like a story I have read with a bad
ending."</p>

<p>"You are a brave girl, Daffodil."</p>

<p>"I don't know why I should be really unhappy. I
have so many to love me. And it doesn't matter if
I should never marry."</p>

<p>Mrs. Forbes laughed at that, but made no reply.
Here was the young lieutenant, who was taking heart
of grace again, though he did not push himself forward.</p>

<p>On the whole it was not an unhappy summer for
Daffodil. She found a great interest in helping Felix
though he was not a booky boy. Always his mind
seemed running on some kind of machinery, something
that would save time and labor.</p>

<p>"Now, if you were to do so," he would say to his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
father, "you see it would bring about this result and
save a good deal of time. Why doesn't some one
see&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You get through with your books and try it yourself.
There's plenty of space in the world for real
improvements."</p>

<p>Daffodil went up to the old trysting place one day.
How still and lonesome it seemed. Had the squirrels
forgotten her? They no longer ran up her arm
and peered into her eyes. He was at Hurst Abbey and
that arrogant, imperious woman was queening it as
my lady. Was all this satisfying him?</p>

<p>It was the right thing to do even if his motives were
not of the highest. To comfort his father in the deep
sorrow, and there was his little son.</p>

<p>"No," she said to herself, "I should not want to
come here often. The old remembrances had better
die out."</p>

<p>She had written to her guardian explaining the
broken marriage, and he wondered a little at the high
courage with which she had accepted all the events.
He had sent her a most kindly answer. And now
came another letter from him.</p>

<p>There had been inquiries about leasing some property
at Allegheny. Also there were several improvements
to be made in view of establishing a future city.
His health would not admit of the journey and the
necessary going about, so he had decided to send
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
his partner, Mr. Bartram, whom she must remember,
and whom he could trust to study the interests of his
ward. And what he wanted to ask now was another
visit from her, though he was well aware she was no
longer the little girl he had known and whose brightness
he had enjoyed so much. He was not exactly an
invalid, but now he had to be careful in the winter
and stay in the house a good deal. Sometimes the
days were long and lonesome and he wondered if out
of the goodness of her heart she could spare him a
few months and if her parents would spare her. Philadelphia
had improved greatly and was now the
Capitol of the country, though it was still staid and
had not lost all of its old nice formality. Couldn't
she take pity on him and come and read to him, talk
over books and happenings, drive out now and then
and be like a granddaughter as she was to his friend
Duvernay?</p>

<p>"Oh, mother, read it," and she laid the letter in her
mother's lap. Did she want to go? She had been so
undecided before.</p>

<p>Bernard Carrick had received a letter also. Mr.
Bartram was to start in a short time, as it seemed
necessary that some one should look after Daffodil's
estate and he wished to make her father co-trustee if
at any time he should be disabled, or pass out of life.
He could depend upon the uprightness and good judgment
of Mr. Bartram in every respect. And he put
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
in a very earnest plea for the loan of his daughter
awhile in the winter.</p>

<p>"Oh, I should let her go by all means," declared
Mrs. Forbes. "You see that unlucky marriage service
has put her rather out of gear with gayeties and when
she comes back she will be something fresh and they
will all be eager to have her and hear about the President
and Lady Washington. And it will cheer her
up immensely. She must not grow old too fast."</p>

<p>Daffodil went to tea at Mrs. Ramsen's and there
was to be a card party with some of the young men
from the Fort. Mrs. Forbes and the captain were at
tea and the Major's wife. They talked over the
great rush of everything, the treasures that were
turning up from the earth, the boats going to and fro.
Booms had not come in as a word applicable to this
ferment, but certainly Pittsburg had a boom and her
people would have been struck dumb if the vision of
fifty or a hundred years had been unrolled. Lieutenant
Langdale came in to the card playing. They
really were very merry, and he thought Daffodil was
not so much changed after all, nor heartbroken. He
was very glad. And then he asked and was granted
permission to see her home. He wanted to say something
sympathetic and friendly without seeming officious,
yet he did not know how to begin. They talked
of his mother, of Archie and how well he was doing.</p>

<p>"And at times I wish I had not enlisted," he remarked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
in a rather dissatisfied tone. "Not that the
feeling of heroism has died out&mdash;it is a grand thing
to know you stand ready at any call for your country's
defence, but now we are dropping into humdrum ways
except for the Indian skirmishes. And it gets monotonous.
Then there's no chance of making money.
I didn't think much of that, it seemed to me rather
ignoble, but now when I see some of those stupid
fellows turning their money over and over,&mdash;and
there's that Joe Sanders; do you remember the wedding
feast and his going off to Cincinnati with his new
wife, who was a very ordinary girl?" and Ned gave
an almost bitter laugh. "Now he owns his boat and
is captain of it and trades all the way to New Orleans."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes." She gave a soft little laugh as the
vision rose before her.</p>

<p>"I remember how sweet you looked that night.
And I had to be dancing attendance on her sister.
How many changes there have been."</p>

<p>"Yes; I suppose that is life. The older people say
so. Otherwise existence would be monotonous as you
said. But you did admire military life."</p>

<p>"Well, I like it still, only there seem so few chances
of advancement."</p>

<p>"But you wouldn't want real war?"</p>

<p>"I'd like an opportunity to do something worth
while, or else go back to business."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span></p>

<p>If she had expressed a little enthusiasm about that
he would have taken it as an interest in his future, but
she said&mdash;</p>

<p>"You have a very warm friend in Captain Forbes."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes;" rather languidly.</p>

<p>Then they talked of the improvements her father
had made in the house. There had been two rooms
added before the wedding. And the trees had grown
so, the garden was bright with flowering shrubs.</p>

<p>"I wonder if I might drop in and see you occasionally,"
he said rather awkwardly, as they paused at
the gate. "We used to be such friends."</p>

<p>"Why, yes;" with girlish frankness. "Father
takes a warm interest in you two boys."</p>

<p>Her mother sat knitting. Barbe Carrick hated to
be idle. Her father was dozing in his chair.</p>

<p>"Did you have a nice time, little one?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. But I am not an enthusiastic card player.
I like the bright bits of talk and that leads to carelessness;"
laughing. "Mrs. Remsen is charming."</p>

<p>Then she kissed them both and went her way.</p>

<p>"She is getting over her sorrow," admitted her
father. "Still I think a change will be good for her,
only we shall miss her very much."</p>

<p>"She has been a brave girl. But it was the thought
of his insincerity, his holding back the fact that would
have rendered him only the merest acquaintance. She
has the old French love of honor and truth."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span></p>

<p>"And the Scotch are not far behind."</p>

<p>Lieutenant Langdale tried his luck one evening.
Mr. Carrick welcomed him cordially, and Felix was
very insistent that he should share the conversation.
He wanted to know about the Fort and old Fort
Duquesne, and why the French were driven out.
Didn't they have as good right as any other nation
to settle in America? And hadn't France been a
splendid friend to us? And why should the French
and English be continually at war?</p>

<p>"It would take a whole history to answer you and
that hasn't been written yet," subjoined his father.</p>

<p>Ned had stolen glances at the fair girl, who was sitting
under grandmother Bradin's wing, knitting a
purse that was beaded, and she had to look down frequently
to count the beads. Yes, she had grown prettier.
There was a fine sweetness in her face that gave
poise to her character. Had she really loved that
detestable Englishman?</p>

<p>They made ready for Mr. Bartram. Not but what
there were tolerable inns now, but taking him in as a
friend seemed so much more hospitable. Daffodil
wondered a little. He had not made much of an impression
on her as a girl. Sometimes he had fallen
into good-natured teasing ways, at others barely noticed
her. Of course she was such a child. And when
the talk that had alarmed her so much and inflamed
her childish temper recurred to her she laughed with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
sense of wholesome amusement. She knew now a
man must have some preference. The old French
people betrothed their children without a demur on
their part, but here each one had a right to his or her
own most sacred feelings.</p>

<p>Mr. Bartram was nearing thirty at this period. Daffodil
felt that she really had forgotten how he looked.
He had grown stouter and now had a firm, compact
figure, a fine dignified face that was gentle and kindly
as well, and the sort of manliness that would lead one
to depend upon him whether in an emergency or not.</p>

<p>Her father brought him home and they all gave him
a cordial welcome for M. de Ronville's sake first, and
then for his own. He had the refined and easy
adaptiveness that marked the true gentleman.</p>

<p>They talked of the journey. So many improvements
had been made and towns had sprung up along
the route that afforded comfortable accommodations.
Harrisburg had grown to be a thriving town and was
the seat of government. He had spent two very entertaining
days within its borders.</p>

<p>"Yes, M. de Ronville was in failing health, but his
mind was clear and bright and had gone back to the
delights and entertainments of his early youth. He
had a fine library which was to go largely to that
started in the city for the general public. He kept
a great deal of interest in and ambition for the city
that had been a real home. Through the summer he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
took many outside pleasures, but now the winters confined
him largely to the house.</p>

<p>"I do what I can in the way of entertainment, but
now that I have all the business matters to attend to,
I can only devote evenings to him and not always
those, but friends drop in frequently. He has been
like a father to me and I ought to pay him a son's
devotion and regard, which it is not only my duty,
but my pleasure as well. But he has a warm remembrance
of the little girl he found so entertaining."</p>

<p>"Was I entertaining?" Daffodil glanced at him
with a charming laugh. "Everybody, it seems, was
devoted to me, and my pleasure was being consulted
all the time. Mrs. Jarvis was so good and kindly.
And Jane! Why, it appears now as if I must have
been a spoiled child, and spoiled children I have heard
are disagreeable."</p>

<p>"I do not recall anything of that. And Jane is
married to a sober-going Quaker and wears gray with
great complacency, but she stumbles over the thees
and thous. Our new maid is very nice, however."</p>

<p>"Oh, that is funny. And Jane was so fond of gay
attire and bows in my hair and shoulder knots and
buckles on slippers. Why, it is all like a happy dream,
a fairy story," and her eyes shone as she recalled her
visit.</p>

<p>They still kept to the old living room, but now
there was an outside kitchen for cooking. And some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
logs were piled up in the wide fire-place to be handy
for the first cold evening.</p>

<p>"M. de Ronville talked about an old chair that
came from France," Mr. Bartram said as he rose from
the table. "His old friend used to sit in it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's this," and Daffodil placed her hand on the
high back. "Won't you take it? Yes, great-grandfather
used it always and after he was gone I used
to creep up in it and shut my eyes and talk to him.
What curious things you can see with eyes shut! And I
often sat here on the arm while he taught me French."</p>

<p>"I suppose it is sacred now?" He looked at it
rather wistfully.</p>

<p>"Oh, you may try it," with her gay smile. "Father
has quite fallen heir to it. Grandfather Bradin insists
it is too big for him."</p>

<p>"I'm always wanting a chair by the light stand so
that I can see to read or make fish-nets," said that
grandfather.</p>

<p>The room was put in order presently and the ladies
brought out their work. Daffodil saw with a smile
how comfortably the guest adapted himself to the old
chair while her father talked to him about the town
and its prospects, and Allegheny across the river that
was coming rapidly to the attention of business men.
What a picture it made, Aldis Bartram thought, and,
the pretty golden-haired girl glancing up now and
then with smiling eyes.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV<br />
<br />
ANOTHER FLITTING</h2>

<p>Mr. Carrick convoyed his guest around Pittsburg the
next day, through the Fort and the historical point of
Braddock's defeat, that still rankled in men's minds.
A survey of the three rivers that would always make
it commercially attractive, and the land over opposite.
Then they looked up the parties who were quite impatient
for the lease which was to comprise a tract of
the water front. And by that time it was too late to
go over.</p>

<p>"Well, you certainly have a fair prospect. And
the iron mines are enough to make the fortune of a
town. But the other is a fine patrimony for a girl."</p>

<p>"There was no boy then," said Bernard Carrick.
"And she was the idol of great-grandfather. She
does not come in possession of it until she is twenty-five
and that is quite a long while yet."</p>

<p>They discussed it during the evening and the next
day went over the river with a surveyor, and Bartram
was astonished at its possibilities. There were
many points to be considered for a ten years' lease,
which was the utmost M. de Ronville would consent
to.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile Aldis Bartram became very much interested
in the family life, which was extremely simple
without being coarse or common. Yet it had changed
somewhat since M. de Ronville's visit.</p>

<p>"And enlarged its borders," explained Daffodil.
"There are three more rooms. And now we have
all windows of real glass. You see there were board
shutters to fasten tight as soon as cold weather came,
and thick blankets were hung on the inside. And
now we have a chimney in the best room and keep
fire in the winter, and another small one in the
kitchen."</p>

<p>"It is this room I know best. It seems as if I
must have been here and seen your great-grandfather
sitting here and you on the arm of his chair. I
suppose it was because you talked about it so
much."</p>

<p>"Oh, did I?" she interrupted, and her face was
scarlet, her down-dropped eyelids quivered.</p>

<p>"Please do not misunderstand me. M. de Ronville
was very fond of your home descriptions and brought
them out by his questions. And you were such an
eager enthusiastic child when you chose, and at others
prim and stiff as a Quaker. Those moods amused me.
I think I used to tease you."</p>

<p>"You did;" resentfully, then forgiving it.</p>

<p>"Well, I beg your pardon now for all my naughty
ways;" smiling a little. "What was I saying? Oh,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
you know he brought home so many reminiscences.
And he loves to talk them over."</p>

<p>"And bore you with them?"</p>

<p>"No; they gave me a feeling of going through a
picture gallery and examining interiors. When I see
one with a delicate white-haired old man, it suggests
Mr. Felix Duvernay. I had a brief journey over to
Paris and found one of these that I brought home to
my best friend and I can not tell you how delighted
he was. And because we have talked it over so much,
this room had no surprises for me. I am glad to find
it so little changed."</p>

<p>"We are&mdash;what the papers call, primitive people.
It seemed queer and funny to me when I came back.
But the ones I love were here."</p>

<p>She paused suddenly and blushed with what seemed
to him uncalled for vividness. She thought how she
had been offered to him and he had declined her. It
was like a sharp, sudden sting.</p>

<p>"I'm glad you don't&mdash;&mdash;" Then she stopped short
again with drooping eyes. The brown lashes were like
a fringe of finest silk. How beautiful the lids were!</p>

<p>"Don't what?" It was a curious tone, quite as if
he meant to be answered.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;why&mdash;not despise us exactly, but think we
are ignorant and unformed;" and she winked hard
as if tears were not far off.</p>

<p>"My child&mdash;pardon me, you brought back the little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
girl that came to visit us. I do not think anything
derogatory. I admire your father and he is a man
that would be appreciated anywhere. And your
grandparents. Your mother is a well-bred lady. I
can find queer and <i>outr√©</i> people not far from us at
home, all towns have them, but I should not class the
Carricks nor the Bradins with them."</p>

<p>"Grandad is queer," she admitted. "He is Scotch-Irish.
And Norry is Irish altogether, but she's the
dearest, kindliest, most generous and helpful body I
know. Oh, she made my childhood just one delightful
fairy story with her legends and her fun, and she
taught me to dance, to sing. I should want to strike
any one who laughed at her!"</p>

<p>"Do you remember Mistress Betty Wharton?"
His tone was quite serious now. "She was one of
the favorites of our town. And she was charmed
with you. If you hadn't been worthy of taking about,
do you suppose she would have presented you among
her friends and paid you so much attention? She considered
you a very charming little girl. Oh, don't
think any one could despise you or yours. And if you
could understand how M. de Ronville longs for you,
and how much pleasure another visit from you would
give him, I do not think you would be hard to persuade."</p>

<p>He had laid the matter before her mother, who had
said as before that the choice must be left with her.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span></p>

<p>He and Felix had become great friends. The boy's
insatiable curiosity was devoted to really knowledgeable
subjects, and was never pert or pretentious.</p>

<p>When he decided, since he was so near, to visit
Cincinnati, Felix said&mdash;</p>

<p>"When I get to be a man like you, I mean to travel
about and see what people are doing and bring home
new ideas if they are any better than ours."</p>

<p>"That is the way to do. And the best citizen is he
who desires to improve his own town, not he who believes
it better than any other. Now, do you suppose
your father would trust you with me for the
journey? I should like to have you for a companion."</p>

<p>"Would you, really?" and the boy's face flushed
with delight. "Oh, I am almost sure he would.
That's awful good of you."</p>

<p>"We'll see, my boy."</p>

<p>"If you won't find him too troublesome. I meant
to take him on the journey some time when urgent
business called me thither. You are very kind," said
Bernard Carrick.</p>

<p>"You see you're not going to have it all," Felix
said to Daffodil. "I just wish you had been a boy,
we would have such fun. For another boy isn't quite
like some one belonging to you."</p>

<p>The child was in such a fever of delight that he
could hardly contain himself. His mother gave him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
many cautions about obeying Mr. Bartram and not
making trouble.</p>

<p>"Oh, you will hear a good account of me;" with a
resolute nod.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the business went on and papers were
ready to sign when the two enthusiastic travellers returned.
Mr. Carrick was to be joint trustee with Mr.
Bartram in Daffodil's affairs.</p>

<p>"It is a pity we cannot take in Felix as well," Mr.
Bartram said. "He will make a very earnest business
man, and I look to see him an inventor of some kind."</p>

<p>Felix had been wonderfully interested in the model
of William Ramsey's boat forty years before of a
wheel enclosed in a box to be worked by one man sitting
in the end, treading on treadles with his feet
that set the wheel going and worked two paddles, saving
the labor of one or two men. It was to be brought
to perfection later on.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Daffodil and her mother discussed the
plan for her visit. It would last all winter. Could
they spare her? Did she want to stay that long? Yet
she felt she would like the change to her life.</p>

<p>There was another happening that disturbed her not
a little. This was Lieutenant Langdale's visit. When
he came in the evening the whole family were around
and each one did a share of the entertaining. And if
she took a pleasure walk she always asked some friend
to accompany her. Mrs. Carrick was not averse to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
a serious ending. Daffodil had reached a stage of
content, was even happy, but the unfortunate circumstance
was rarely touched upon between them. It
seemed as if she had quite resolved to have no real
lovers. What if an untoward fate should send the
man back again. The thought haunted the mother,
though there was no possible likelihood of it. And
her sympathies went out to the lieutenant.</p>

<p>If she went away, he would realize that there was
no hope of rekindling love out of an old friendship.
It would pain her very much to deny him.</p>

<p>They spoke of her going one evening, quite to his
surprise.</p>

<p>"Oh," he said regretfully, "can you not be content
here? I am sure they all need you, we all do. Mrs.
Forbes will be lost without you. You are quite a star
in the Fort society."</p>

<p>"In spite of my poor card-playing," she laughed.</p>

<p>"But you dance. That's more real pleasure than
the cards. And we will try to have a gay winter for
you. But after all we cannot compete with Philadelphia.
I believe I shall try to get transferred from this
dull little hole."</p>

<p>"I do not expect to be gay. The great friend I
made before married and went to Paris. And M. de
Ronville is an invalid, confined mostly to the house
during the winter. I am going to be a sort of companion
to him. He begs so to have me come."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span></p>

<p>Archie would be there. A sudden unreasoning
anger flamed up in his heart and then dropped down
to the white ashes of despair. Was there any use
caring for a woman who would not or could not care
for you? There were other girls&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"You have really decided to go?" her mother said
afterward.</p>

<p>"Oh, I hate to leave you." Her arms were about
her mother's neck. "Yet for some things it seems
best. And the old story will be the more easily forgotten.
I may make it appear of less importance to
myself. It has grown quite dreamlike to me."</p>

<p>"Yes," answered the mother under her breath.</p>

<p>So the fact was accepted. "You will never regret
giving a few months to an old man near his journey's
end," said Mr. Bartram. "And I am very glad for
his sake."</p>

<p>Then preparations were made for the journey.</p>

<p>"You must not want for anything, nor be dependent
on your good friend," said her father. "And
have all the pleasures you can. Youth is the time to
enjoy them."</p>

<p>It gave them a heartache to let her go. Mrs. Craig
wished she could be her companion again, but she was
too old to take such a journey. And now travelling
was a more usual occurrence, and she found two ladies
who were going to Harrisburg, and who had travelled
a great deal, even been to Paris. Aldis Bartram was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
much relieved, for he hardly knew how to entertain a
being who was one hour a child and the next a serious
woman. The last two years he had sought mostly
the society of men. There were many grave questions
to discuss, for the affairs of the country were by
no means settled.</p>

<p>It was a very pleasant journey in the early autumn.
She enjoyed everything with so much spirit and delight,
but she was never tiresomely effusive. The
ladies had come from New Orleans and were full of
amazement at the rapid strides the country was making,
and the towns that were growing up along the
route. Their stay in Pittsburg had been brief and
they were much amused at some of the descriptions
of the earlier days the little girl could recall, the memories
of the French great-grandfather, who had lived
almost a hundred years, and grandad, who in his
earlier years had been what we should call an athlete
and was a master hand at games of all sorts. They
were much in vogue yet, since there were no play-houses
to draw people together for social enjoyment.</p>

<p>Mr. Bartram used to watch her with growing interest.
Yes, she would be invaluable to M. de Ronville,
and a great relief to him this winter. How had
she so easily overlived the great blow of her wedding
day! She was a very child then, and truly knew
nothing about love.</p>

<p>"We shall be in Philadelphia sometime before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
Christmas," explained Mrs. Danvers, who was a
widow. "We are thinking of settling ourselves there,
or in New York, and we shall be glad to take up the
acquaintance again. We have enjoyed your society
very much, and truly we are indebted to Mr. Bartram
for many favors that a maid is apt to blunder over.
Women never get quite used to the rougher ways of
the world."</p>

<p>"And I shall be glad to see you again," the girl
said with unaffected pleasure. "I have enjoyed the
journey with you very much."</p>

<p>How did she know just what to say without awkwardness,
Mr. Bartram wondered.</p>

<p>The quiet street and the old house seemed to give
her a cordial and familiar greeting. Mrs. Jarvis herself
came to the door.</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear, we are so glad to have you back
again," she cried with emotion. "But how tall you
are! You are no longer a little girl."</p>

<p>"I have the same heart after all that has happened;"
and though she smiled there were tears in her eyes.</p>

<p>A slow step came through the hall, and then she
was held close to the heart of her guardian, who had
longed for her as one longs for a child.</p>

<p>Yes, he was quite an old man. Pale now, with
snowy hair and beard, and a complexion full of fine
wrinkles, but his eyes were soft and tender, and had
the glow of life in them.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh," he exclaimed, "you still have the golden
hair, and the peachy cheeks, and smiling mouth. I
was almost afraid you had changed and grown grave.
And your voice has the same ring. I am so thankful
to your parents for sparing you again. And, Aldis,
you must not mind me, for the business has fallen so
behind that I shall not feel neglected if you go to the
office at once. We will devote the evening to talk.
Are you very tired with your journey?" That to Daffodil.</p>

<p>"No, it was so pleasant and entertaining, and some
of it beautiful. Then I do not tire easily."</p>

<p>M. de Ronville held her hand as if he was afraid
she might escape, and his longing eyes touched her
very heart. But Mrs. Jarvis stepped up on the stairs,
and giving him a tender smile, she followed.</p>

<p>Nothing had been changed. Why, she might have
left it only yesterday.</p>

<p>As if Mrs. Jarvis had a similar thought about her
she said, "My dear, you are just the same, only
grown up."</p>

<p>"And everything here is the same. I am very
glad; it is like home."</p>

<p>There was the pretty dark blue-and-white toilette
set, where the blue looked as if somehow it had melted
a little and run over the white. She smiled, thinking
how she used to wonder about it.</p>

<p>"This is Susan, our new maid. Mr. Bartram may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
have told you that Jane was married. She has a
good husband and a nice home. But Susan fills the
place very well, and now she will wait upon you with
pleasure," announced Mrs. Jarvis.</p>

<p>Susan courtesied and smiled. She was younger than
Jane, a fresh, fair-looking girl, who had the appearance
of having been scrubbed from top to toe.</p>

<p>"And now, when you are ready, come down to
the library and have a cup of tea. Oh, I remember,
you didn't care for tea, that's an old ladies' comfort.
Well, there are other refreshing things that will stay
you until supper. We have our dinner now in the
middle of the day. M. de Ronville likes it better.
Feel thoroughly at home, child."</p>

<p>Susan unpacked her belongings and put them in
drawers and the spacious closet, where Daffodil
thought they must feel lonesome.</p>

<p>She went downstairs presently, fresh and bright,
having chosen her simplest frock, and tied her curls
in a bunch behind, instead of putting them high on
her head with a comb. On her pretty neck she wore
the chain and pendant M. de Ronville had given her.
She looked very sweet and youthful.</p>

<p>He motioned her to the sofa beside him.</p>

<p>"I understand how it is, that children and grandchildren
keep one young," he began. "It is the new
flow of life that vivifies the old pulses. And I advise
all young men to marry;" smiling a little. "After
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
awhile business loses its keen interest, and when you
have made enough, why should you go on toiling and
moiling? Then comes the time you want to take an
interest in younger lives. And now tell me about
your mother and father, who is prospering greatly,
Aldis has written. And the little brother."</p>

<p>She was in full flow of eager talk when Susan
brought in the tray with some tea and dainty biscuits,
and golden-hearted cake, and Mrs. Jarvis followed
her and drew up the little table.</p>

<p>"You see, I am quite pampered. I like a cup of
tea at mid-afternoon, for the reason that it makes a
break in a rather lonely time. I go out in the morning,
when I can, but I take the garden and the porch
in the afternoon, and in the evening friends drop
in."</p>

<p>Daffodil had a glass of milk. There were some delightful
sandwiches, and she was really hungry, as
they had not stopped for much dinner at noon. And
as she glanced around she saw more cases had been
added, and were filled with books, and two or three
paintings and beautiful vases. The room did have a
cosy aspect, with some easy chairs that were just coming
in for elderly people. Young people were expected
to sit up straight.</p>

<p>Afterward they walked in the garden. There were
choice late roses in bloom, and flowers she had never
seen before. Smooth paths of sand beaten hard, here
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
a way of fine white gravel that looked like a snowy
ribbon between the green. How beautiful it was!
This was what money and education and taste could
do. Pittsburg was beginning to have the money, to
prosper and boast, but all things seemed in a muddle,
compared to this.</p>

<p>She was merry and sweet, and yet it did not seem
to her as if it came from a true heart. Was she
sorry she had come. Was not her place back there!
Was it not her duty <i>not</i> to outgrow Pittsburg, for
there she must live her life out. And when she was
an old lady there would be Felix, who would marry
and have children growing up, true Duvernays, for
he would take the name, not her husband.</p>

<p>When they went in the paper had come, and she
read that to him. She had stepped so naturally into
the old place. Susan began to arrange the table, Mr.
Bartram came in looking really fagged out, but cordially
attentive and chatty with the happenings.</p>

<p>It was a sort of high tea, and there was an air about
everything different from their simplicity at home, but
Mr. Bartram had adapted himself so readily to that.
Was it out of kindly consideration?</p>

<p>"Now, I am going to dismiss you, my little dear,"
exclaimed the old man gently, "for I want to hear
what Aldis has to say. And you have been very sweet
and patient. Promise that you will not disappear in
the night."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, I promise. I am not a bird that I could fly
back in the night, and then I think only evil birds fly
at that period."</p>

<p>He kissed her on the forehead. She sat on the
porch awhile with Mrs. Jarvis, and then went to
bed in the room that was sweet with rose and lavender.
Well, so was her pillow at home. But it was
so still here. Even the insects seemed to have modulated
their shrillness. She buried her face in the
softness and cried. Was she regretting the change?
Was some gladness, some hope, lost out of her life,
that could never come again?</p>

<p>It was bright morning when she woke. Even the
very sun seemed to shine in gladness. Susan came,
bringing her some water, and wished her good-morning.
Yes, it should be a good morning and a good
day.</p>

<p>They went to drive when the mists of the night had
blown away. Oh, how gay everything looked!
Stores had increased, beautiful buildings had gone up,
and there was the President's residence. Lady Washington,
as many people still called her, came out with
her maid and her black servant, with a huge basket.
There were others doing the same thing, for it was
quite a fashion of the day, though some people were
beginning to be waited on by the market men. Ladies
in carriages and men walking or riding bowed to M.
de Ronville, and wondered who the pretty girl beside
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
him could be. He quite enjoyed the surprised look
they gave her.</p>

<p>Then he took a rest on the sofa, and begged her to
tell him of the changes they had made in the house,
and the boats her father was building, and what
new industries had been started. And was grandad
as bright and merry as ever? And the ignoble whiskey
insurrection; the soldiers at the Fort!</p>

<p>Everything had so much interest for him, and the
time passed so rapidly, that Mr. Bartram came home
before they hardly thought of dinner. He asked with
a smile if she was homesick yet, and although she
shook her head with vague amusement, she wondered
why she had cried last night? They had some bright
talk and then M. de Ronville asked her if she did not
want to go shopping with Mrs. Jarvis, who would
like very much to have her. Mr. Bartram had brought
some papers that must be looked over and signed.
But she must not stay out too late for his cup of afternoon
tea.</p>

<p>The shopping was really a great diversion. They
met several people, who remembered her. And how
funny it seemed to pay away so much money for an
article, but then there seemed plenty of paper money.</p>

<p>Chestnut Street was gay with riders, both men and
women, and some of the latter looked fine in their
dark-green habits and gilt buttons. There were many
promenading, dressed in the quaint style of the day,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
and not a few Friends in silvery-gray, with the close-fitting
scuttle-shaped bonnets.</p>

<p>"I am so glad you have come," was Susan's greeting.
"There are two ladies waiting to see you, Miss
Daffodil, and M. de Ronville would make me bring in
the tea for them."</p>

<p>"Oh, what are their names?" cried the girl eagerly.</p>

<p>"I was not to tell you;" and a smile lurked behind
Susan's lips.</p>

<p>She ran upstairs and took off her hat and mantle,
and came into the library wondering.</p>

<p>"Oh;" pausing to think for a moment. "It's Miss
Pemberton, and&mdash;is it Belinda?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you haven't changed a bit, except to grow
tall;" and Belinda almost hugged her. "But Mary
is Mrs. Hassel, and has the darlingest little boy you
ever saw. Oh, do you remember our party out on
the lawn, and our picnic? I'm so glad you have
come again. I'm the only girl home now;" and then
Belinda blushed deeply.</p>

<p>"And Mr. de Ronville would have us share his tea.
I've heard it's a kind of English fashion, which he
ought not countenance, since he is French, I tell him,"
said Mrs. Hassel jestingly. "But it is delightful. I
think I'll start it. A cup of tea seems to loosen one's
tongue."</p>

<p>"Do women really need the lubrication?" asked M.
de Ronville with a smile.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, they do. Think of three or four different
women hardly knowing what to say to each other,
and after a few sips of tea they are as chatty as you
please. But I must say I was so delighted with his
charming news that I would have waited until dark
for the chance of seeing you."</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you;" and Daffodil blushed prettily.</p>

<p>"And we know a friend of yours, at least Jack
does, a young doctor, who is going to be great some
day, and who is from Pittsburg, Dr. Langdale."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I knew he was studying here."</p>

<p>"And he has made one or two remarkable discoveries
about something or other. Dr. Rush considers
him one of the coming men."</p>

<p>"I am very glad to hear that. Oh, we all seemed
children together. And his older brother is a lieutenant
at Fort Pitt."</p>

<p>"Can't he get a furlough? I'd like to see him," said
Belinda gayly.</p>

<p>"He's tired of dull Fort Pitt, and was talking of
getting exchanged. That isn't quite right, I believe;
it sounds as if he was a prisoner."</p>

<p>"We must go," insisted Mrs. Hassel. "We will
hardly have time for another call. M. de Ronville
has been so fascinating."</p>

<p>"Oh, did I hold out a fascination?" mischievously.</p>

<p>"It was both," admitted Belinda. "And now we
want to see ever so much of you. Mary, give us a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
regular tea party; she only lives round in Arch Street.
And you will want to see the baby."</p>

<p>"Of course I will," said the young girl.</p>

<p>Then they made their adieus. Susan took away the
tea-things.</p>

<p>"Was the shopping nice?" enquired her guardian.</p>

<p>"Oh, there are so many lovely things! I didn't
mean to buy anything, you know, but we looked at
such an elegant pelisse. Only everything costs so
much!"</p>

<p>"Oh, economical little girl!"</p>

<p>"And the shopwoman would try on such a splendid
white beaver that had just come in with a beautiful
long plume and a white satin bow on top. Why, I
felt as if I had just arrived from Paris!"</p>

<p>M. de Ronville leaned back and laughed. She
looked so pretty and spirited, standing here. He could
imagine her in the white beaver and handsome
pelisse.</p>

<p>"How about the French?" he asked. "Have you
forgotten it all?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no. Grandmere and I talk sometimes."</p>

<p>"We must have a little reading. Why, <i>we</i> could
talk as well. I sometimes get rusty."</p>

<p>"It was very nice of the Pembertons to remember
me," she said reflectively.</p>

<p>"I had said you were likely to come, and they heard
Mr. Bartram had returned. So they came at once."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span></p>

<p>She could see he was proud of the compliment paid
her.</p>

<p>"Now, you are tired," he said. "I'll read the
paper for myself."</p>

<p>"No, no." She took it away playfully. "When
my voice gets shaky, you may ask me to stop;" and the
mirth in her tone was good to hear.</p>

<p>How delightful it was to lean back comfortably and
listen to the pleasant voice, with its subtle variations.
Ah, if Aldis Bartram could have made sure of her
in that other time, before she had learned to love and
had her sorrow. And now he seemed to be settled in
bachelor ways, and resolved to miss the sweetness of
love and life.</p>

<p>"Aldis," he said, at the tea table, "do you know
young Dr. Langdale?"</p>

<p>"In a way. He is not in my line, you know. A
very promising young fellow. Were you thinking
of trying him?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no. But he is from Pittsburg. The Hassels
and Miss Pemberton seem to know him quite well.
And he is a friend of Daffodil's."</p>

<p>"Oh, and is that lieutenant his brother?"</p>

<p>Daffodil blushed, though why, she could not have
told, and she merely nodded.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Hassel seems to think very highly of
him."</p>

<p>"He's made some sort of discovery&mdash;they had him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
at Dr. Rush's, and he is in a fair way to success.
Score one for Pittsburg."</p>

<p>"But he has been studying here," rejoined Daffodil
frankly.</p>

<p>The next day it rained, and rainy days seemed to
affect M. de Ronville, but he hardly noted it. They
read and talked French, and had a rather laughable
time. And in the afternoon an old friend, Colonel
Plumsted, came in to play chess, and Daffodil
watched, much interested. Aldis was surprised to
find his host in such good spirits when he returned.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hassel gave her tea party soon after. Daffodil
met several old friends, who remembered the little
girl. Belinda found time to impart the secret that she
and Jack Willing were engaged, though she meant to
have one good winter of fun before she was married.
Jack seemed to be a nice, jolly fellow. And there was
Anton Wetherell and Arthur Pemberton, and Arthur
was asked to take her out to the supper table.</p>

<p>"Why, it's quite like old times to have you here
again! Truly, I never thought of your growing up.
You were always in my mind as a little golden-haired
fairy that flashes about and then&mdash;do they return to
the 'little folk'?"</p>

<p>"I haven't, you see. But I was not quite a fairy.
And one grandfather used to call me Yellowtop." She
laughed musically.</p>

<p>"One? How many grandfathers did you have?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span></p>

<p>"I had three at one time, one in every generation.
But the oldest one went away, and now there are
only two."</p>

<p>"And I danced with you, I remember. I hope you
haven't forgotten how. We have dancing parties, as
well as tea parties. We are considered quite staid
and sober-going people, but we young folks put in a
good deal of fun. Bel's engaged, I dare say she told
you, and I am the only solitary&mdash;shall I call myself a
blossom? left on the parent stalk."</p>

<p>They both laughed at that. It takes so little to
amuse young people.</p>

<p>"You'll have to go to one of Lady Washington's
receptions, though in the whisper of confidence be it
said they are rather stiff. There's the Norris house,
that's the place for fun. The Norris girls find so
many bright people, and they're not the jealous kind,
but they make everybody shine."</p>

<p>Then Bel took her off to meet Miss Plumsted.</p>

<p>"I'm very glad to see you;" and Miss Plumsted's
voice was honestly sweet. "Grandfather goes to
play chess with M. de Ronville. He is your guardian,
I believe. And now, are you going to live here?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no. I am here only on a visit. My parents
and all my folks live at Pittsburg."</p>

<p>"Oh, that seems way out West. The Ohio River
is there, and they go out to St. Louis and down to
New Orleans. Is it a real city?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span></p>

<p>"Not yet, but they are talking about it."</p>

<p>Then some one else came. Two or three of the
young men dropped in during the evening, and there
was some music on a flute and a violin. Altogether it
was a very pleasant time, and Arthur Pemberton took
her home and asked if he might not have the pleasure
of calling occasionally.</p>

<p>She hardly knew what was proper. It seemed ungracious
to say "no," so she answered that he might.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI<br />
<br />
SAINT MARTIN'S SUMMER</h2>

<p>One of the quiet evenings, the two men were playing
chess and Daffodil was watching them; Susan came in
and said in her most respectful manner:</p>

<p>"A gentleman wishes to see Miss Carrick. Here is
his card."</p>

<p>Daffodil took it and read, "Archibald Langdale,
M.D."</p>

<p>"Oh," in a glad, girlish tone, "it's my old friend,
Archie, that I haven't seen in ever so long. Dr. Langdale;"
with a pretty assumption of dignity.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And, uncle, you must see him. Not that I want
you to accept him for a family physician, for really I
don't know what he is like. He may be the veriest
prig;" and she gave a dainty half laugh. "If he is
spoiled it will be the fault of your city, he was very
nice at Pittsburg. And you, too, Mr. Bartram."</p>

<p>"I have met the young man. I didn't see that he
was much puffed up with his honors."</p>

<p>"Thank you." She made a fascinating courtesy.
How pleased she was, he could see that.</p>

<p>"We will soon be through with the game. Yes,
I'll come," said M. de Ronville.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span></p>

<p>She would hardly have known Archie. He stood
up straight and he was quite as tall as Ned. He had
filled out somewhat, though he was still rather thin,
but his face had lost that deprecating expression, and
had a clear notion not only of truth and honor, but
of his own power as well. It was a tender face also,
with the light in it that draws one unconsciously.
The eyes seemed to have grown darker, but the hair
was light as in boyhood.</p>

<p>"I am so glad to see you again;" and he took both
hands in a warm clasp. "I couldn't wait until some
accidental meeting, where you might kindly invite me
for old friendship's sake."</p>

<p>"That would not have been worth while. I have
heard about you, and I wondered if you had outgrown
childish remembrances."</p>

<p>"You would bring them all back if I had. How
little you have changed, except to grow tall. And
now tell me about yours and mine. Once in a great
while Ned writes, and mother doesn't seem to have
the gift of chatty letters. Hers are mostly about my
humble self, <i>her</i> son rather, and how he must avoid
certain things and do other certain things, and not
grow hard-hearted and irreligious and careless of his
health;" smiling with a touch of tenderness. "So,
you see, I do not hear much about the real Pittsburg."</p>

<p>"Oh, you would hardly know it now, there are
so many changes, and so much business. New streets,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
instead of the old lanes, and the old log houses are
fast disappearing. We are making real glass, you
know, and there is talk of a paper mill. And nearly
all the girls are married; the older ones, I mean. Families
are coming in from the country, others go out to
Ohio and Kentucky. Why, it is a whirl all the
time."</p>

<p>"I'd like to see it and mother. I've planned to
go several times, but some study or lectures that I
couldn't miss would crop up. And it takes so much
time. Why doesn't some one invent a quicker way
of travelling? Now, if we could fly."</p>

<p>"Oh, that would be just splendid!" eagerly.</p>

<p>"I used to watch the birds when I was a boy, and
flying seemed so easy for them. Now, why can't
some one think up a pair of wings that you could
slip on like a jacket and work them with some sort
of springs, and go sailing off? I'm learning to put
people together, but I never was any hand for machinery."</p>

<p>"Oh, think of it! A winged jacket;" and they both
laughed gleefully.</p>

<p>Then M. de Ronville entered and expressed his
pleasure at meeting the young man, who was already
distinguishing himself, and who was an old friend of
Miss Carrick.</p>

<p>"Not that either of you are very old," he commented
smilingly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Bartram he recalled. And certainly the generally
quiet student talked his best. Was Daffodil a
sort of inspiration? Was that one of the graces of
early friendship?</p>

<p>He apologized presently for his long stay. He so
seldom made calls, that he must plead ignorance of the
correct length, but he had enjoyed himself very much.
And then M. de Ronville invited him to drop in to tea.
He would like to discuss some new medical methods
with him.</p>

<p>"A very intelligent, well-balanced young man," the
host remarked. "If the other one is as sensible, they
are sons to be proud of."</p>

<p>"Their mother <i>is</i> proud of them, but their father
would rather have had them in business," said Daffodil.</p>

<p>Belinda Pemberton was quite fascinated with Daffodil.
"You are such a sweet, quaint, honest little
thing," she said, "and you do make such delightfully
na√Øve remarks. And Arthur declares you must have
learned to dance in fairyland."</p>

<p>"I think I did," she returned gayly. "And I do
love it so."</p>

<p>Then the little circle, and the wider one, had a fine
surprise. Betty Wharton, now Madame Clerval, returned
quite unexpectedly, as her husband had resigned
his position.</p>

<p>"I had quite enough of Paris," she said to a friend.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
"One wants an immense fortune to truly enjoy it.
And somehow things seem shaky. Then, too, one
does have a longing for home when one gets past
youth."</p>

<p>So she opened her house and set up a carriage.
Monsieur Clerval found himself quite in demand by
the government, as the country needed a multitude
of counsellors.</p>

<p>She came in to see M. de Ronville, who gallantly
said she had renewed her youth, and begged for the
secret.</p>

<p>"It is simply to keep young, to resolve <i>not</i> to grow
old;" with a gay emphasis.</p>

<p>"But time passes, my dear lady."</p>

<p>"And where is that pretty, golden-haired Daffodil?"
she enquired.</p>

<p>The girl was summoned. Yes, she had outgrown
childhood, but there was a delightful charm in her
young womanhood.</p>

<p>"We were such friends&mdash;if you can remember so
far back."</p>

<p>"And you were so good to me, and made everything
so enjoyable. Wasn't I very ignorant?"</p>

<p>"You were very frank, and honest, and adaptable.
So we must take up the old intimacy again. M. de
Ronville, I shall drop in often and say, 'Lend me your
daughter for this or that occasion.' Or is it your
niece? And if some one falls in love with her you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
must not scold me. Young men have eyes, and really,
I am too kindly-hearted to throw dust in them."</p>

<p>Daffodil turned scarlet.</p>

<p>"Is it quite right to go about so much?" she said
to M. de Ronville afterward, and the tone had a great
uncertainty in it, while the curves of her pretty mouth
quivered. "For you know&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He drew her down beside him on the sofa.</p>

<p>"I thought some time we would talk it over&mdash;your
unfortunate marriage, I suppose, comes up now and
then to haunt you. Yet, it was fortunate, too, that
the explanation came just as it did. I honestly believe
it was an ignorant child's fancy. You were not old
enough to understand real love. I think he could
hardly have been a thorough villain, but an incident
like this has happened more than once. And I truly
believe you have overlived it."</p>

<p>She shuddered, and her eyes were limpid with tears.
It was good to feel his friendly arm about her.</p>

<p>"It is like a dream to me, most of the time. And I
think now, if he had made a passionate, despairing
protest, it would have gone much harder with me. But
it was right for him to go away when his father sent,
and he was the next in succession to Hurst Abbey.
And there was his child, his boy. I could never have
been his true wife, but it hurt to be given up so
readily, yet it was best. It gave me courage. And
what if he had tired of me later on? They all helped
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
me to bear it. And there was the deception. For if
he had told the truth, there might have been pity, but
no love."</p>

<p>"It was a sad thing to happen. My heart ached
for you. But you know, Daffodil, you never were a
wife in the true sense of the word. You are quite
free, you have always been free. And you must feel
so. You must not carry about with you any uncertainty.
It is something buried fathoms deep, that
you need never draw up to the surface, unless in
time to come you tell the story to the man you
marry."</p>

<p>"I shall never marry," she returned gravely. "I
have it all planned. Felix shall have the fortune, for
what could a woman do with it in her own hands?
And he has the name, he has only to leave off the
Carrick. And it shall be my business to make every
one as happy as I can. And if it is not wrong to take
pleasure for myself&mdash;I do love joy and happiness, and
I could not grieve forever, when I knew the thing I
would grieve for was wrong."</p>

<p>There were tears dropping off the bronze lashes,
but she was not really crying. He pressed her closer.
There was an exquisite depth to her that did not often
come to the surface.</p>

<p>"So you have it all planned for the years to come,"
he returned after a moment or two. "That is quite
far off. Meanwhile you must have a good time with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
other young people. That will make me the happiest,
if you care for me."</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed I do, indeed I do," she cried earnestly.
Then, after quite a pause, she continued&mdash;</p>

<p>"I almost lost sight of what I wanted to ask. It
was whether I ought to explain anything, whether it
would be sailing under false colors when no one
knew;" and she gave a tangled sort of breath that she
would not allow to break into a sob.</p>

<p>"My dear child, there would be no use in explaining
what could only be a matter of gossip. I think, nay, I
am certain, Aldis and myself are the only ones who
know, and if there had been any trouble I should have
sent him to your assistance. I dare say, some of your
friends and neighbors at home have wellnigh forgotten
about it. And now, do not let it disturb you, but
be as happy as God meant you should be, when He
snatched you from the peril."</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you," she rejoined with a grateful
emotion that he felt quiver through her slender
body.</p>

<p>She wondered if she was too light-minded, too
easily pleased. For every joyous thing seemed to
come her way. The girls sought her out, the young
men wanted to dance with her, and were willing to
bore themselves going out to supper, if they knew she
would be there. It was not because she was brighter
or wittier than the others, or could think of more entertaining
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
plays, but just that she seemed to radiate
an atmosphere of happiness.</p>

<p>She did not give up all her time to pleasure. She
drove with her guardian on pleasant days; he had left
off riding now, but he sent her out occasionally with
Mr. Bartram, lest she should get out of practice, he
said. Then she read to him, or they took up French.
She made merry over her blunders.</p>

<p>The autumn was long and warm. They sat in the
garden in the sunshine, or walked up and down. Now
and then he went to the office, when there were some
important matters on hand.</p>

<p>Madame Clerval gave a dance after she had her
house set in order. It might have been called a ball.
It was mostly for the young people; she was just as
fond of them as ever, and secretly admitted that she
didn't enjoy prosy old people, who could talk of
nothing but their pains and aches, and how fast the
country was going to ruin.</p>

<p>"Do you think Mr. Bartram would consider it a
nuisance to come for me?" she asked of her guardian,
with a face like a peony.</p>

<p>"Why, no, child. Madame made quite a point of
his coming. He is growing old too fast."</p>

<p>"Why, he isn't old," she said rather indignantly.
"And you see&mdash;it's hard sometimes not to offend this
one or that one, and if he is really coming, will you
ask him to bring me home? Wouldn't <i>you</i> prefer it?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span></p>

<p>"I think I would;" very gravely, though he wanted
to smile.</p>

<p>Wetherell and Arthur Pemberton were pushing each
other for her favors, and she tried to distribute them
impartially.</p>

<p>The dance was a splendid success, and the dainty
supper had a French air. Mr. Bartram came in just
before that. Daffodil was engaged, of course.
Madame provided him with a charming partner.</p>

<p>There was only a galop afterward. At private affairs
it was not considered good taste to stay after
midnight. Mr. Bartram made his way to Daffodil,
and asked her if she was ready to go, and she nodded
gracefully.</p>

<p>She looked so pretty as she came down the stairs,
wrapped in something white and fleecy, smiling on this
side and that.</p>

<p>"It was very enjoyable," he said, "at least to you
young people. I'm not much of a dancer nowadays,
so I didn't come early."</p>

<p>"It was just full of pleasure. Madame Clerval
always plans admirably."</p>

<p>He smiled to himself. Most girls would have protested
about his being late, even if they had not specially
cared.</p>

<p>The young people took up the habit of calling in the
evening, three or four of them, sometimes half a
dozen. Mrs. Jarvis would send in some cake and nice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
home-made wine, which was quite a fashion then.
They made merry, of course.</p>

<p>"Dear uncle," she said one morning, it was raining
so they couldn't go out, "didn't we disturb you last
evening with our noise and laughter? I don't know
why they are so eager to come here, and think they
have a good time, for I am not as full of bright sayings
as some of the girls. And if it annoys you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My child, no. I lay on the sofa and listened to
it, and it almost made me young again. I had no
merry youth like that. Oh, am I coming to second
childhood?"</p>

<p>His eyes were bright, and she thought she had never
seen them so merry, save at first, when he had laughed
at some of Felix's pranks. And his complexion was
less pallid, his lips were red.</p>

<p>"Then second childhood is lovely. And you have
grown so interested in everything. You don't get
tired as you used. Are you real happy, or are you
doing it just to make me happy?"</p>

<p>She gave him such a sweet, enquiring look, that he
was touched at her solicitude.</p>

<p>"It is both, I fancy. You see, last winter I was ill
and alone a great deal. I missed Betty Wharton, who
was always flying in with some fun, or a bright story
that had been told. Aldis had all the business to attend
to, and sometimes wrote in the evenings. Time
hung very heavy on my hands, and I began to think
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
it was time for me to go hence. And by spring I had
quite lost heart, though I began to crawl about a little.
And I kept thinking how I should live through another
dreary winter, and be half sick. It kept looming
up before me. Then I thought I ought to settle something
about your business when your father wrote concerning
the lease. You came into my mind. I
thought how brave you had been through that unfortunate
time, and wondered if you would not like
a change. I wanted some one to bring in the sunshine
of youth, and you had spent so many of your
years with elderly people, I thought you must have
some art. I could make it pleasant for you, and the
reflected light would brighten me. So I begged a little
of your sweet young life."</p>

<p>"I am glad if it has made you happy," she said,
much moved.</p>

<p>"It has given me new zest, it has made me almost
well. True, I have had some twinges of my old
enemy, rheumatism, but they have not been severe. I
have not been lonely. There was some pleasure
within my reach all the time. Oh, old people do want
a little of the sun of youth to shine on them. And
if you had no dear ones at home, I should keep you
always, golden-haired Daffodil."</p>

<p>She took his hand in hers, so full of fresh young
life. "And I should stay," she said.</p>

<p>"So, do not think your little merry-makings annoy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
me at all. I am glad for you to have them, and next
day it is like reading a page out of a book, a human
book that we are apt to pass by, and say we have no
pleasure in it, but it is what we need, and what we
want, down in our very heart of hearts, but often we
are ashamed to ask for it."</p>

<p>It was true, he was much better. The house was
losing its grave aspect. Jane had been used to flinging
about wise old saws, and comparisons, and finding
things to enjoy; Susan was quiet, falling into
routine, and staying there until some new duty fairly
pushed her out in another direction. She had no sense
of humor or enthusiasm, yet she performed all the
requirements of her place with ease and industry.</p>

<p>Mrs. Jarvis was just as kindly solicitous as ever, but
intellectually there was a great gulf between her and
M. de Ronville. She entertained whatever guests
came with an air of precision, never forgetting she
was a higher sort of housekeeper. She enjoyed the
quiet of her own room, where she sewed a little,
and read a good deal, the old-fashioned English novels,
such as "Children of the Abbey," "Mysterious
Marriage," "The Cottage on the Cliff," and stories of
the latter half of the century. She thought it no part
of a woman's business to concern herself with politics,
she would have preferred living under a real King
and nobility, but she accepted the powers that ruled,
and stayed in her own little world, though she, as well
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
as M. de Ronville, enjoyed the stir and interest that
Daffodil brought about.</p>

<p>After Madame Clerval came, there was more variety
and gayety in Daffodil's life, and she helped to
rouse M. de Ronville as well. Then came a reception
at the Presidential mansion.</p>

<p>"Of course, you will go," Madame said to him, in
her persuasive, yet imperious, manner. "We must
not be a whit behind those New York people in the attention
we pay our President. And one need not
stay the whole evening through, you know. You will
meet so many old friends. Come, I cannot have you
getting old before your time."</p>

<p>"But I am an old man," he protested.</p>

<p>"In our new country we must not get old. It
is to be the land of perennial youth," she answered
gayly.</p>

<p>Aldis Bartram joined his persuasions as well, and
M. de Ronville went almost in spite of himself. He
had kept his delicate, high-bred air and French atmosphere,
and looked well in the attire of that day, with
his flowered waistcoat, his black velvet suit and silk
stockings, with a jewelled buckle on his low shoes.
His beautiful white hair was just tied in a queue, with
a black ribbon. There was something dignified and
gracious about him, and friends thronged around to
congratulate him. And though he had seen Washington
in many different phases of his eventful life, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
had not as yet met him as President of the nation he
had fought for and cemented together.</p>

<p>There were handsomer girls than Daffodil; indeed,
the fame of the beauties of Philadelphia in that day
has been the theme of many a song and story. But
she was very pretty in her simple white frock that in
the fashion of the day showed her exquisite neck and
shoulders, though the golden curls, tied high on her
head, shaded and dazzled about it in a most bewitching
manner. Madame Clerval was wise, she was not
trying to outshine any of the belles, yet there was a
bevy of young men about her constantly, and most
devoted to her and to M. de Ronville, was Dr. Langdale.
In fact, he was really the favorite visitor at
the house. He ran in now and then with news of
some new book, or some old translation, and a talk of
the progress of the library and the trend of general
education. Why should Boston have it all? Or a
new medical discovery, though he was in no sense M.
de Ronville's physician.</p>

<p>Was it strange that both these young people, having
passed their childhood in Pittsburg, should come to a
nearer and dearer understanding? Aldis Bartram
watched them with the sense of a new revelation.
Yet he could not subscribe to it cordially. The medical
enthusiast was hardly the one he would choose
for a girl like Daffodil. Arthur Pemberton would do
better, yet he was not quite up to her mark. She
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
was a simple seeming girl, yet he was learning that
she had a great deal of character and sweetness.
Somehow she kept herself curiously enfranchised from
lovers. Her friendly frankness gave them a status
it was difficult to overcome.</p>

<p>"I never expected to enjoy myself so much again,"
said M. de Ronville, when they were in the carriage.
"It is an excellent thing to go on moving with the
world, to keep in touch with the things that make
up the sum of life, instead of feeling they belong to
the gone-by time, and you have no interest in them."</p>

<p>How much like his olden self he was, Aldis
Bartram thought. He wondered if he had been at
fault in letting him drop down. There was much
perplexing business, and he had hated to bother the
elder man with it. Sometimes it seemed tedious to
explain. Had he grown selfish in certain ways, preferring
to take the burthen, rather than the trouble of
sharing it with another? He had much personal ambition,
he was in full earnest of a man's aims and life
purposes. Yet it was this man who had helped him
to the place whereon he stood, and it was not honorable
to crowd him out under the plea that his best
days were over.</p>

<p>It seemed, indeed, as if days fairly flew by, there
was so much crowded in them. When the morning
was fine, Daffodil insisted they should drive out. It
was delightful to keep bowing and smiling to friends,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
with this attractive girl beside him. He went to some
meetings of the Philosophical Society, and he took a
new interest in the Library plans.</p>

<p>"You certainly have worked a transformation,"
Bartram said to Daffodil, when M. de Ronville consented
to go to a concert with them, to hear two remarkable
singers, who had come from abroad. "You
will have to stay. Didn't I hear you discussing Pittsburg
with Mrs. Jarvis?"</p>

<p>"Oh, they are longing for me to return. And in
two days March will come in, that will be spring. And
I was only to stay through the winter."</p>

<p>"But March is a cruel and deceitful travesty on
spring. February has been too short."</p>

<p>"But they want me. And, yes, I want to see them
all, and the garden, and the woods, and what new
things have happened to Pittsburg. For there is
something new coming in all the time."</p>

<p>Her face was so eager and full of happy interest.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;I don't know what we shall do without
you"; and the inflection of his voice was disconsolate.
"I am afraid we shall fall back to the old routine. I
am a busy man, you know, and have to shoulder a
great many cares not really my own. Perhaps, too, I
haven't the divine art of making a house bright, a
woman's province."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Bartram, I will tell you;" in a clear,
earnest tone. "Why do you not marry, and bring
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
some one here to do it? There are so many charming
girls, sometimes I feel quite unimportant and ignorant
beside them."</p>

<p>She uttered it in the same manner she might have
asked why he did not bring home some flowers to
grace the study table. Her lovely eyes were raised to
his in the utmost innocence, and not a tint of color
wavered on her cheek. His flushed with sudden surprise.</p>

<p>"Perhaps the charming young girl would consider
it a dull house for life, and then elderly people have
whims and fancies&mdash;well, younger men do. I have
myself. And it would be asking a good deal."</p>

<p>"I think uncle hasn't many whims, and he does
keep them in the background. You almost have to
watch for them. Why, think of grandad!" and she
laughed with a soft musical sound. "What he liked
yesterday he may not like at all to-day, so Norry does
the new thing, and says nothing about the other. And
he often disputes with father as to whether there was
any real need for the war, and that we would be better
off under King George. But uncle is so large-minded,
and then he has so many refined and delightful tastes.
But you would get lonesome if you were not very well,
and no one came to cheer you up, or bring you new
thoughts and bright bits of things, that were going
on in the world outside."</p>

<p>She paused suddenly, and flushed like a culprit,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
looking more beguiling than ever, with her downcast
eyes.</p>

<p>"I suppose I oughtn't have said it, but it seems
true to me, only I'm not blaming you. You have a
great many things to attend to, and you must do them
in a man's way, devote your whole mind to them, and
you can't be frivolous, or other people's business would
suffer. If I hadn't any one I would come and stay,
but&mdash;I love them, and sometimes, in spite of the pleasure,
my heart is almost torn in two with the longing.
I said I would come back in the spring, and I must go.
Then it will not be quite so bad, for Madame Clerval
will be in and out, and he is so much better. And
you'll let him take an interest in business, when he
feels like it&mdash;oh, I seem to be giving you advice, and
I sincerely beg your pardon. After all, I am not much
more than a little girl, and I am talking as if I was
old and wise;" and a sudden shame flamed her cheeks
with scarlet.</p>

<p>"I think you have been wise, and sweet, and patient,
without growing old. You have done a great deal
for your guardian this winter&mdash;I really was afraid we
should not have him with us for very long, and he did
seem to wish for you so. Perhaps we were selfish,
he and I."</p>

<p>"Oh, I was ready to come, too. It has been a delightful
winter, and everybody has been so good to
me, I've been just full of pleasure. But when you love
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
those you have left behind, you sometimes feel as if
you could fly."</p>

<p>She winked very fast, then made a sudden dab at
her eyes, and half laughed, too.</p>

<p>"I think I understand. I have had no one to love
dearly since I was a little lad, and all I remember
about my mother is that she was pale, and ill, and
could not endure a noise. Then I was put in school,
and my father went away and died. When I was
eighteen I went in M. de Ronville's office, and finished
my studies. He has been my best friend, really like
a father to me. I ought to make all the return in my
power."</p>

<p>"Oh;" and there was a bewildering sweetness in
her tone. "I have been so happy most of my life,
and had so many to love me."</p>

<p>Then that unfortunate episode had not cost her any
deep-seated grief. Had she loved at all, or was it only
a childish fancy? He hoped it was, for the sake of
her future.</p>

<p>He turned then and went out of the room. M. de
Ronville had been up in his dressing-room, with his
valet, and now he went to the library, and she followed
him. There were some reports to look over,
then the carriage came for them. It was sunny, with
very little wind, and they had plenty of wraps.</p>

<p>Aldis Bartram went his way to the office. The two
clerks were there and busy. He opened his letters,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
and answered several, the others had need of some
legal opinions to be looked up. Then he took up a
rather complicated case, but he soon lost the thread
of it, for Daffodil's almost upbraiding voice haunted
him. He had been outwardly patient many a time
when all was irritation within, for he was too manly
and too really grateful to show impatience.</p>

<p>Had Daffodil's being there this winter proved the
source of the reaction in M. de Ronville's health?
Had loneliness intensified the disease and discomfort?
Perhaps. And now two or three young men dropped
in, and had entertaining talks with him. Or was it
because they liked the byplay of the pretty, vivacious
girl, who never made herself the first attraction.</p>

<p>"Marry some pretty, charming young girl!"
Where would he find one to M. de Ronville's liking?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII<br />
<br />
OH, WHICH IS LOVE?</h2>

<p>March opened cold and stormy. Rheumatism made
a clutch at M. de Ronville. For several days he did
not come downstairs, but insisted that some of the
guests must come to him. Dr. Langdale skipped
away from a lecture he really desired to hear, and
spent an hour comforting the invalid. Madame Clerval
came in with a budget of news and friendly gossip,
and Daffodil talked of her little girlhood, and old
Pittsburg, as they had begun to call it, and sitting on
the arm of great-grandfather's chair, and listening
to tales of a still older time. He did not wonder
that his friend Duvernay had lived to be almost a
hundred, with all that affection to make the way
pleasant.</p>

<p>Then he improved and came downstairs, took up
chess-playing, and little promenades on the porch when
the sun shone. And then the talk veered round to
Daffodil's departure. He would not hear anything
about it at first.</p>

<p>"Yet we have no right to keep her away from her
own household, when she has been brave enough to
give up all the winter to us," Mr. Bartram said.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, no, I suppose not. If I was younger, or in assured
health, I should go and spend the summer with
them. Oh, don't look so startled. I know it wouldn't
do, with my uncertain health."</p>

<p>Aldis smiled. "If the summer is fine, and you keep
pretty well, we might both take a trip. I would hardly
trust you to go alone."</p>

<p>"So we might." The elder was gratified with the
consideration.</p>

<p>"Aldis?" presently, in a half-enquiring tone.</p>

<p>"Well?" glancing up.</p>

<p>"Do you think&mdash;that Dr. Langdale&mdash;that there is
anything between him and Daffodil?"</p>

<p>"There has been some talk. But young Pemberton
is devoted to her as well."</p>

<p>"With either she would have to come back here to
live. I like the doctor. He is such a fine, large-hearted,
sympathetic young fellow, with so much real
charity for suffering. I seem to be envying other
people's sons and daughters;" ending with a longing
sound. "Yes, if she were in love with him."</p>

<p>Aldis Bartram experienced a feeling of protest.
Yet, why should he object? They were both young,
they had been friends from childhood, and he was
certainly worthy of her.</p>

<p>That very evening he dropped in. There had been
a wonderful surgical operation on a poor fellow, who
had been mashed and broken by a bad fall. There
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
had been a dispute at first, whether they could save
him intact, but after hours of the most careful work
there was a good chance. Dr. Langdale was so proud
and enthusiastic, giving every one his due with no narrowness.</p>

<p>Then he said, "Oh, Daffodil, are you really going
home?"</p>

<p>"They have sent for me. The winter has gone!"
and there was a piquant smile hovering about her
face.</p>

<p>"It has been such a short winter I have not done
half the things I planned to do. But I am resolved
to run away some time in the summer. It is ungrateful
not to visit mother. And I do want to see
the town, and all the old friends."</p>

<p>"Oh, do come!" There was a joyous light in her
eyes, and a sweetness played about her lips.</p>

<p>Yes, he surely thought he would. Then they went
on about other matters. Bartram was not much
versed in love indications, but something rose within
him&mdash;as if there should be a higher, stronger, more
overwhelming love for <i>her</i>.</p>

<p>She would make them talk cheerfully about her going.
She said sagely there was such a thing as wearing
out one's welcome, and that now she should feel
free to come again.</p>

<p>"Next winter," said her guardian. "I think I
can get along through the summer with this thought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
to sustain me, but I shall be a year older, and perhaps
more feeble."</p>

<p>"I strictly forbid either of the consequences;" she
laughed with adorable gayety, her eyes alight with
fun.</p>

<p>"One would think I was of great consequence,"
she exclaimed a few days later, "by the lamentations
my friends make. Or is it a fashion? It will make
it harder for me to go. If we could move Pittsburg
over! But there are the splendid rivers, and the hills
covered with rhododendrons. And, you see, I shall
miss the daffodils."</p>

<p>"If it is such sorrow to part with one, I hardly
know how you can endure losing so many," said Aldis
Bartram gravely.</p>

<p>She looked at him enquiringly. He seldom paid
compliments to any one but Madame Clerval.</p>

<p>There were bloom and beauty enough in the grand
old town, where every point was romantic. Every
day Daffodil and her guardian were out driving, until
it seemed to her she could have found her way
about in the dark. And in his office Aldis Bartram
sat thinking how lonely the house would be without
the sunshine of her golden head, and the sound of
her sweet, merry voice, her small, thoughtful ways,
and the ease with which she could change from one
mode of action that she saw was not bringing about a
desirable result. At first he considered this a sort
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
of frivolity, but he understood presently that she not
infrequently gave up her own pleasure or method for
something that suited M. de Ronville better.</p>

<p>He was ambitious, and he had marked out a career
for himself. He meant to be rich and respected, his
instincts were all honorable, and this had commended
him to his employer, who detested anything bordering
on double dealing. So, from one position he had
been advanced to another, and by persistent study had
taken his degree with honor. He enjoyed the life of
the class with which he was in keen touch, and he
found he could maintain a degree of mental superiority
that satisfied his ambition.</p>

<p>There had been a partnership; he was junior counsel,
and some of the clients preferred the young, broad-minded
man. Then had come the proffer of a home
that really surprised him. There were no relatives
to be jealous; why, then, should he not be as a son to
this man, who no longer felt equal to the burthen and
heat of the new day that had dawned on the country,
and was calling forth the highest aims and energies
of the men of the time?</p>

<p>There had been one intense fascination in his life
that had turned to the ashes of bitterness. And now,
while he was affable and enjoyed the society of
women, he considered himself proof against their
blandishments. He had heard of Daffodil's interrupted
marriage, and gave her a very sincere sympathy.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
But he had not been warmly in favor of her
visit. Still, it seemed cruel and selfish not to agree
to the longing of the invalid, who had an obstinate
idea that his days were numbered. A pet and play-thing
was perhaps what he needed, for sometimes the
devotion exacted bored him and seemed a painful
waste of time and energy.</p>

<p>Then M. de Ronville saw the necessity of arranging
his guardianship of Daffodil Carrick on a different
basis, so that there might be no trouble at his death.
Her father might not understand all the fine points,
and need some legal aid. This had brought about the
visit to Pittsburg, and he had joined his solicitation
to that of the guardian, truly believing M. de Ronville's
days were numbered, and he did fervently desire
to give him whatever happiness and comfort was possible.</p>

<p>But Daffodil was different from the vague idea he
had formed of her. She was not a sentimental girl, even
if she had been caught by a specious love, and though
gay and eager, had a tender, truthful, and noble side
to her nature. They were all of a higher class than
he had thought possible, and Felix he considered quite
an unusual boy. Mr. Carrick had made one brief explanation
of the marriage, none of the others alluded
to it.</p>

<p>"But you know that the law holds her as an unmarried
woman. There was nothing binding in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
vows on her side, and pure fraud on his," said Bartram
decisively.</p>

<p>"Yes, we are aware of that, but young as she is, it
has changed her in some respects. But she is dearer
than ever to us. I deprecate this fashion of such
youthful marriages, though mine has been very
happy," returned the father.</p>

<p>Dr. Langdale came in one morning with a face full
of the highest satisfaction. Bartram had been lingering
about, discussing the journey. Madame Clerval
had offered one of her French maids, but she knew so
little of American ways.</p>

<p>"Daffodil," the doctor exclaimed, "will you take
me for an escort? I find there is nothing very important
for the next few weeks. I have but one more
lecture in my course. And I do want to see mother.
So, if you have no objection&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why, I should be delighted, though I begin to
feel quite like a wise and travelled body. And think
how women are coming from abroad and from
Canada, and going West, and all over, and reach
their destination safely. But I shall be very glad
all the same, and your mother will be wild with
joy."</p>

<p>"I am afraid we do not think of the pleasure we
can give our elders, who, in the nature of things, have
less time for the enjoyment of their children. And I
feel ashamed that I have allowed the time to slip by,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>
content with a hurried letter. I mean to do better in
the future."</p>

<p>"And I applaud your decision," exclaimed M. de
Ronville. "Oh, I think you young people really do
not know how much happiness you can give us elders
just by the sight of your happy faces, and a little
cordial attention."</p>

<p>Daffodil glanced at Dr. Langdale with a smile that
seemed almost a caress, it was so approving, enchanting.
Aldis Bartram caught it and turned away,
saying&mdash;</p>

<p>"I must leave you to perfect arrangements. I am
late now, so I must wish you good-morning," bowing
himself out of the room.</p>

<p>He was very busy, and did not go home to dinner,
as he had been doing of late. And it was not until he
was walking home in the late afternoon that he allowed
himself to think of Daffodil's departure.</p>

<p>"She will marry Dr. Langdale and come back here
to live, which will be a great pleasure to M. de Ronville,"
he said to himself, remembering it had his
friend's approval. And why should it not have his?
Yet he felt as if he did not cordially assent. And if
she returned next winter&mdash;he lost a sudden interest
in the plan. They would be lovers and there would be
their joy and satisfaction flaunted in everybody's
face.</p>

<p>How could Daffodil keep so bright and cheerful?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
Had she any real depth? Did not every change, every
new plan appeal to her just the same?</p>

<p>But if he had seen her with her arms about Mrs.
Jarvis' neck, and the tears in her eyes, he would not
have made the comment to himself. And the tender,
beseeching tone in which she was saying&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, you will not let him miss me too much. And
when it is pleasant, won't you walk about the garden
with him and praise his roses and the flowers he cares
for? And keep him thinking that he is better, and has
years yet to live, and if Mr. Bartram will go on being
devoted to him."</p>

<p>"Mr. Bartram seems to have grown more tenderly
thoughtful. Of course, he has a great deal on his
mind, and now there are so many perplexing questions
about the country, and when one is tired out with
the day's work it is hard to rehearse it all over. Oh,
my dear, I think you have worked a change in us all
with your sweet, generous ways, and your lovely outflowing
youth. I am afraid I was beginning to think
too much of my own comfort."</p>

<p>Dr. Langdale proved himself most solicitous. Bartram
found the planning was taken quite out of his
hands, and he chafed a little. Madame Clerval declared
herself inconsolable, but she had the fine grace
that speeds the parting guest when the going is inevitable.</p>

<p>There was only one day more. M. de Ronville had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
his breakfast sent upstairs. Daffodil went to find
some papers her guardian was going over, and turning,
she met Aldis Bartram entering the library.</p>

<p>"I was afraid you might forget them," she said,
handing the packet to him.</p>

<p>"Thank you." How often she had charged her
mind with these little things.</p>

<p>"I suppose," he began in a wandering sort of tone,
as if his mind had strayed to something else, "that it
will not really be out of order to congratulate you,
since it will be a long while before I shall see you
again."</p>

<p>"Oh, about going home? But I shall often think
of you all here, and wish the old fairy stories were
true, where you could be transported elsewhere in a
moment. I think I did truly believe in them once."</p>

<p>How charming she was in that absolute simplicity,
the exquisite, innocent, glowing face too frank for
concealment. He had no business to probe her secret,
and yet he must know.</p>

<p>"Oh, I meant, you will not come back to us the
same. You will have learned the lesson of love, and
I hope&mdash;you will be very happy."</p>

<p>"I don't understand"&mdash;a puzzled line settling in her
fair brow. "Oh!" suddenly relieved, and then half
smiling, "did you think," and then her face crimsoned
to its utmost capacity, "that I, that Dr. Langdale&mdash;it
is a mistake. We were dear friends in childhood, we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
are warm friends now. For, you see, he has been like
a little bit of Pittsburg to me, and sometimes, when I
was longing for the dear ones at home, it was comforting
to talk them over. And he has no thought of
marrying in a long, long while. He means to do so
much first."</p>

<p>Was she a finished coquette by the grace of nature?
Young men were not given to consideration of this or
that when the bewildering passion seized them. But
coquette or not, a sharp, overmastering knowledge
seized him. Once she had advised him to marry and
bring in the household a charming girl. She recognized
that his duty would be to M. de Ronville while
he lived. He knew that, too, if he would not prove
himself an ingrate. And here was the charming girl.</p>

<p>He looked at her so long and steadily that there
came faint colors in her face, growing deeper, the lines
about her mouth showed tremors, the bronze-fringed
lids drooped over her eyes, and she turned away. But
the delicious half-bashful movement set his pulses
aflame.</p>

<p>"Daffodil," and he caught her hand, "if there is
no other among these young men, or even at home,
may I not sue for a little favor? I know it surprises
you; then perhaps I am too old to win a young girl's
regard, love I mean&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, you must not," she interrupted. "For I
think you hardly like me&mdash;you did not at first. And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
then, I&mdash;well&mdash;I do not mean to marry. You know
there was the&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Which simply has no weight in your life."</p>

<p>"But you see, I thought I loved him. Oh, I <i>did</i>
love him. And I was so happy. Why, I would have
gone to the end of the world with him! Only when
one deceives you, when one dares not tell the whole
truth, and when one cannot, does not want to give
up wealth and station, what was love is some way
crushed out. But how could I tell if any new love
was the right thing? I might be mistaken again.
And there are fickle women in the world I have heard,
who can love many times. I don't desire to be
one of them. Maybe it is only friendship I am fitted
for."</p>

<p>She was trembling in every pulse, though she had
made such a brave defence. And she seemed to him
a hundred times sweeter than she ever had before.
He had much ado not to clasp her to his heart. "My
dear little Daffodil," he said with passionate tenderness,
"though you have been wooed and said marriage
vows, you know nothing about a true and fervent love.
That was not much beyond a child's fancy, and you
have overlived it, or you could not be so light-hearted.
It is only a dream in your life. And I will wait until
the woman's soul in you wakes. But I shall not let
you go from my influence, I shall keep watch and
ward, and try to win you."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span></p>

<p>"No, no, I am not worth all that trouble. No, do
not try," she pleaded.</p>

<p>"I shall take your earlier advice. You said I must
marry some charming girl and bring her here. No
other girl or woman could satisfy M. de Ronville as
well."</p>

<p>"Did I advise you to do that?" and she blushed
daintily. "Well," and there was a glint of mischief
in her eyes, soft as they were, "once I was offered to
you, and you declined."</p>

<p>"Offered to me?" in surprise.</p>

<p>"When I was here before. It was in this very
library. I was outside, and when I knew who was
meant I ran away."</p>

<p>"Oh, you were such a child then! And I was doing
something that I have always despised myself for.
I knew a beautiful and fascinating woman, who led
me to believe she cared a great deal for me. And then
she laughed at my folly. I deserved it for my blindness.
So you see, I too had a rude awakening, and
found that it was not love, but a mere sham. I believe
for a month or so I have been trying <i>not</i> to love
you, shutting my eyes to a longing that stirred all my
nature. And now that I have admitted it, it has taken
a giant's growth in a few hours. I will wait until
you can give me the true, sincere regard of your soul.
But I could not let you go until I had settled whether
I had any ground for hope. Shall we be friends,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
dear and fond friends, until that time? But I want
to be loved sincerely, deeply."</p>

<p>She stood like a lovely culprit before him, and then
he did enfold her in his arms, and pressed his lips
against her blushing cheek.</p>

<p>"Oh, I cannot tell&mdash;yes, I like you&mdash;and you will
be good to <i>him</i> while I am gone. But it is new and
strange to me, and I cannot promise."</p>

<p>"But there is no one else&mdash;tell me that."</p>

<p>"There is no one else. But whether&mdash;I can love
again;" and there was a great tremble in her voice,
"whether it would be right."</p>

<p>"Oh, little innocent, you will find the right and
the truth some day, I feel assured of that. I can trust
you to tell me by word or sign when that day comes,
for I know you will be honest. And now I must go,
but I take with me a joy that will make glad the
days and weeks of separation. Oh, my little darling!"</p>

<p>He went out of the house with a proud tread. He
would never pause until he had won her. His soul
was startled and roused by the sudden revelation of
himself. He had supposed he should marry sometime,
after his duty was done here, for he could not
imagine a woman broad enough to share it with him.
And here an angel had touched him with her fine
beneficence, and shown him the duty in a stronger,
truer light.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span></p>

<p>There was not much time for the ardent side of love,
though Aldis Bartram had to fight with himself for
a show of mere friendliness. She was to go at ten
the next morning, and friends came to escort her.</p>

<p>"And I shall stay and help our good friend to bear
the trial of parting," declared Madame Clerval. "We
will talk over your virtues and your shortcomings, the
lovers you might have had if you had been an astute
young woman, and try to shed some sunshine on the
doleful days until next winter."</p>

<p>There was the maid with some budgets, there was
Dr. Langdale, proud and serene enough for a lover,
and it did rouse a spasm of jealousy in the soul of
Aldis Bartram. But he knew she was truth itself,
and he could depend upon her.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII<br />
<br />
A REVELATION</h2>

<p>It was a lovely journey if the term could be applied
to the old-fashioned stagecoach. But the season of
the year, the bloom and beauty everywhere, and the
pleasant companionship lightened the few discomforts
for Daffodil. There are natures that refrain from
spoiling anticipations by cares or perplexities left behind,
and hers was one. Indeed, hers was not complex,
and people, women especially, had not learned
to crowd so many interests, and fears, and hopes together.
She would see those she loved the best, yes,
she did love them the best of all now.</p>

<p>How glad they were to get her back! Yes, there
were changes and changes. New business plans and
firms, old ones enlarged, discoveries of coal and iron
all about, materials for glass-making, a paper mill
under consideration.</p>

<p>But the war was not yet over. The advisers of the
King had begun to adopt a tone of insolence toward
the young Republic; indeed, in spite of peace being
signed, there was still an endeavor to stir up the Indians
on the outskirts of many of the towns. The Indian
villages along the Maumee received supplies of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>
arms and ammunition, and were fortifying their own
forts. The alarm spread down the Ohio. The
British had not yet given up all the forts they
had held in the preceding war, in spite of the agreements.</p>

<p>Tired of inaction, Lieutenant Langdale had, with
several others, offered his services to General Anthony
Wayne, as there was great need of trained officers.
So Mrs. Langdale was doubly delighted with
this visit of her son, of whom she was quite as proud
as of her soldier.</p>

<p>"And I hope you have made good your chance with
Daffodil Carrick," she said to him a few days after
his return. "She'll be quite worth the winning, even
if the father's money should all go to the son, who is
a very promising lad, I hear. But they count on having
a big place over the river, and that is all her share.
One of you boys ought to win her. I thought it
would be Ned. And you have had a chance all
winter."</p>

<p>Archibald smiled, but there was no disappointment
in it.</p>

<p>"She was a great favorite all through the winter,
and she can marry any time she likes. But I have
too much to do to take upon myself family cares, and
I think she isn't the sort of girl to be in a hurry. We
are just fine, sincere friends."</p>

<p>"But I want you to marry. And I've counted on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
grandchildren. I wish I had you both settled just
around me. I shall be a lonesome old woman."</p>

<p>"Then when I am rich enough to set up a house,
you shall come and live with me."</p>

<p>"Do you think Dilly's going to let that miserable
mess of a marriage spoil all her life?"</p>

<p>"Oh, she is very happy, mother; girls don't marry
as young as they did, and it is a good thing, too. They
have some years of bright, gay girlhood, and won't
get worn out so soon. Daffodil is a charming
girl."</p>

<p>"But she's getting quite along, and it isn't like being
a widow either," said the mother, who thought
every girl ought to marry.</p>

<p>Daffodil watched mother and grandmere with longing
eyes. Yes, grandmere <i>was</i> getting old. Her
mother was losing the pretty girlishness, but she was
very happy in her husband, and her son, who was
tall and very good-looking, quite toned down in
manner.</p>

<p>The house had no more changes. Here was her
pretty room. Oh, yes, there was a new bright rag
carpet on the floor. She went around with a tender
touch on everything, patting the white pillow-slips,
straightening a picture or two, and wondering in a
curious fashion if sometime her brother's wife would
be here and a group of merry children&mdash;she hoped
there would be a houseful of them. And gran would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>
be a great-grandfather, and sit in the big chair at the
corner of the fireplace, that he had covered over with
buckskin of his own tanning. Where she would be
she did not plan. Only she would not mind being
an old maid, she thought.</p>

<p>Everybody in the little circle supposed she would
marry Dr. Langdale, and were surprised when his
mother sorrowfully admitted it was not to be.</p>

<p>"There's them that goes through the woods, and
picks up a crooked stick at the last;" and Norah shook
her head resentfully.</p>

<p>"My stick won't be crooked, I promise you,"
laughed the girl.</p>

<p>"You may have no stick at all and go limping
afoot and alone," was the curt rejoinder.</p>

<p>She was very happy, why she could hardly tell, for
she felt she ought not to be. There came a letter
with the stamp of the office on it and it had two enclosures.
Her guardian's was most pleasant and fatherly.
They missed her very much, but Mrs. Jarvis
had taken on a new phase of kindliness so that he
should not long too much for Daffodil, and Aldis was
like a son. They went out driving together. And
Aldis had grown so fond of the garden that he had
not used to care much about. The weather was fine
and he really was quite well for an old gentleman.</p>

<p>She almost dreaded to open the other. A blinding
sort of consciousness pervaded her as if she were a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>
prisoner, as if there was asked of her a curious, undefined
surrender that she could hardly understand.
Before, she had gone on simply and been overtaken, as
it were, given without knowing just what she gave.
Was it because she was older, wiser? She had still
to learn that there were many mysteries in love that
only a lifetime could explain.</p>

<p>She let her eyes wander over it in a vague sort of
fashion. Did she really belong to him? He seemed to
take possession of her in a way that she could not
gainsay, could not even refuse.</p>

<p>But did she want to refuse?</p>

<p>She went out to the keeping room after awhile.
Her mother sat alone, sewing some trifle. She came
and laid both letters in her lap, then went and sat on
the door sill where a great maple threw its green arms
about in the soft breeze. There was a cuckoo somewhere,
a yellow-hammer searching for half-hidden
food, and a thrush with his long, sweet note.</p>

<p>"Yes," her mother remarked, as if in answer to a
question. "He laid the matter before your father a
month ago in the letter that came with you."</p>

<p>"Oh!" Then after a long while&mdash;"Mother, it is
nothing like it was before. Then I did not doubt
myself, now I wonder. He is so wise in many ways,
I feel as if I had to reach up and up and I am a little
afraid. I have seen so many fine girls in the city.
And beautiful women."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span></p>

<p>"The woman a man chooses is the best to him
always."</p>

<p>She did not torment herself with the thought that
he was doing this for her guardian's sake. She felt
that he was not the kind of man to take the mere
crumbs of love while some one else feasted on the
heart of love divine. What troubled her was whether
she could love enough. And she hated to think there
had been any previous regard. But did he not say,
too, that he had been fascinated by an unworthy
liking?</p>

<p>The summer seemed to check the wave of prosperity
and men looked at each other in half affright.
For no one knew just how the tide might turn. When
the Indians made their sortie on Fort Recovery word
came that the garrison had been massacred, but Captain
Gibson bravely held it in spite of an all-day attack,
and at night the enemy retreated. General
Wayne was in command of all the forces and the Indians
made various feints, hoping to be joined by the
British, who were urging them on, but there was no
big regular battle until that of Fallen Timbers, where
a tornado had swept through the woods some time
before. A few miles below was a British fort, the
meeting place of the western fur traders. It was a
hard fought field, but the victory for the Americans
was such a signal one that it ended the terror of a
frontier war that had hung over the border so long.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span></p>

<p>No town rejoiced more than Pittsburg, which lost some
men and was proud of heroes who had come through
the conflict unscathed. Among these was Lieutenant
Langdale, whose bravery and foresight gained him a
captaincy.</p>

<p>"He's a brave fellow!" declared grandad, and
Daffodil was glad he had won some of the fame and
glory for which he had longed.</p>

<p>"It's fine to be a soldier when you can fight and
have nothing happen to you," declared Felix. "But
I wouldn't want to be among the killed. There's so
many splendid things in life. I hope I will live to
be a hundred."</p>

<p>There were many matters to share Daffodil's attention,
though she did miss the bright society and the
knowledge branching out on every side. Yet these
girls who had married half a dozen years ago and had
grown common and careless with their little ones about
them seemed very happy. It certainly was an industrious
community, but they played as they worked.
There were games that would have been no discredit
to modern scores, there was dancing and merriment
and happiness as well.</p>

<p>Was Daffodil learning her lesson? Aldis Bartram
thought very slowly. But he was a man who prized
hard won contests. And if with the attractive young
men about her through the winter she had not been
won, then she was not an easy prize. He smiled at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>
times over her careful and futile reasoning. At least
they would have the winter to go over the ground.
And though he was becoming an ardent lover he was
not an impatient one.</p>

<p>There are some events and decisions in life that are
precipitated by a shock, the film that held one in thrall,
veiling the clear sight, is suddenly disrupted. And
this happened to Daffodil Carrick. Her father put
an English paper in her hand one evening as he came
up the path where roses were still blooming. It had
been remailed in Philadelphia.</p>

<p>"From Madame Clerval," she said with a smile.
"Some gay doings, I fancy. She has friends in London."</p>

<p>She glanced it over carelessly. The summer struggles
had made her more of a patriot, and brought to
her mind vividly the morning she had run out to
know the cause of Kirsty Boyle's call and the ringing
of his bell. A very little girl. She was always glad
she had heard it.</p>

<p>She turned the paper to and fro rather impatiently.
Oh, what was here with the black insignia of death:
"<i>Died, at Hurst Abbey, of a malignant fever. Margaretta,
wife of Jeffrey, Lord Andsdell, only remaining
son of the Earl of Wrenham.</i>"</p>

<p>She was not interested in the beauty of the bride,
who had been a great belle in her day and won no
little fame on the stage, nor the terrible accident that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>
had deprived the Earl of two older sons and two
grandsons, paving the way for the succession of Lord
Andsdell. She shuddered and turned ghostly pale,
and was terrified with a strange presentiment. But
she could not talk of it just yet and was glad
Norry and grandad came in to spend the evening with
them.</p>

<p>The next morning she gave her father a little note
with "important" written on the corner of the folded
paper.</p>

<p>"What now?" enquired her father laughingly,
"Did you forget your postscript?"</p>

<p>She assented with a nod.</p>

<p>Then she went about her daily duties, but a great
terror surged at her heart. She was to remember
through everything that she was the only woman Jeffrey
Andsdell loved. Long ago she had cast it out.
No doubt he had been happy in his ancestral home, at
least, he had chosen that, well, wisely, too. But to
ask that the woman he wronged should cling to her
burthen!</p>

<p>How slowly the days passed. Aldis Bartram might
have been away when the note came&mdash;he had been to
Baltimore on some troublesome business&mdash;but waiting
seemed very hard. And when it drew near to the
time, she used to take different paths down by the
square where the stage came in, just far enough away
to see, but not be seen, and stand with a blushing face
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
and a strange trembling at her heart. One day she
was rewarded. There was the manly figure, the erect
head, the firm, yet elastic step. A sudden pride leaped
up in her heart.</p>

<p>She waylaid him in a bypath.</p>

<p>"Daffodil!" he cried in surprise. "What has happened?</p>

<p>"Nothing, nothing; I wanted to see you," but her
voice trembled. "Come this way."</p>

<p>"How mysterious you are!" If she meant to give
him his <i>cong√©</i> she could have done it better by letter.
And the clasp of her hand on his arm had a clinging
force.</p>

<p>"There is something for you to see. Let us turn
here."</p>

<p>After a space through intervening trees they came
to the open, where she paused and unfolded a paper
she had held in her hand. "Read this," she said, and
he stared a moment silently.</p>

<p>One moment, another moment. How still it was,
every bird had hushed its singing, even the crickets
were not chirping.</p>

<p>"He will come back to America. He will come
back for you now that he is free," Bartram subjoined
hoarsely. Should he hold her or let her go? Was the
old love&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>She faced him and slipped both hands over his
shoulders, clasped them at the back of his neck. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
seemed to him he had never seen such an entrancing
light in her eyes.</p>

<p>"Aldis," she began, with tremulous sweetness, "I
would rather be your wife than the greatest duchess
of them all." And then she hid her blushing face on
his breast.</p>

<p>It would not be raised, but he kissed the brow, the
eyelids, and said in a shaken voice:</p>

<p>"Were you afraid&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Then she raised the sweet face where he saw tears
and the quick rifts of color, but there were high lights
of resolve in the beautiful eyes.</p>

<p>"Not afraid anything could rekindle the glamor of
that mistake, nor any repentance on his part mend the
deception. I was a child then. I did not understand
the depths that go to the making of a true love. All
summer I have been learning&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Then she paused and hid her face again.</p>

<p>"And there is a great deal more to learn, sweetheart.
We shall go on studying the delightful lesson
all our lives, I trust, and never reach the bottom of
the cup of joy. Daffodil, you have already roused me
to a wider, higher life. A year ago I would not have
been worthy of you. Yes, I was blind and self-engrossed
then. We will study the sweet lesson together."</p>

<p>Then they paused at a fallen log, not the old place
that she never cared to see again. A little stream came
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span>
trickling down the high hill and there were tender
bird voices as accompaniments to the delicious confession.
It had grown slowly, she was so afraid of
another mistake, but he would never need to doubt its
truth, its duration, its comprehensiveness.</p>

<p>It seemed minutes only and yet held the mysterious
sweetness of hours. Then she heard a voice calling.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;see! It is almost night! And that is
Felix's voice. Oh, what have I been doing?" and she
rose in a startled manner.</p>

<p>"We will explain our iniquity," he said laughingly.</p>

<p>They met Felix. "Oh!" he exclaimed in surprise.
"We couldn't think! And we had supper."</p>

<p>Then mother said, "Why, did you come in the
stage? That was here hours ago," to Mr. Bartram,
in a wondering tone.</p>

<p>"Yes; but we had a good deal of business to settle.
I hope you didn't eat up all the supper?"</p>

<p>He studied them both curiously. Daffodil's face
was scarlet.</p>

<p>"Mr. Bartram, are you going to marry her?" he
asked with a boy's frank eagerness.</p>

<p>"I hope to. Are you going to object?"</p>

<p>"No," rather reluctantly. "Only I wish you were
going to live here."</p>

<p>Bernard Carrick had gone downtown. It showed
the strides Pittsburg had made when there was already
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span>
a downtown. Barbe stood in the doorway
watching, for now the sky was growing gray with
coming evening. But before Mr. Bartram spoke,
she knew. One of the delights of the other engagement
had been the certainty of keeping her daughter,
now the pang of separation pierced her to the
quick.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Carrick," he said in an appealing tone, "will
you take me for a son?" but Daffodil kissed her.</p>

<p>They did not want much supper, but the others returned
to the table and talked. He had only come for
a few days, but he begged that they might have a
wedding in the early fall, just as soon as possible indeed,
for the journey was so long they could not
afford to waste much time in courtship. They must
be lovers afterward.</p>

<p>So, after much discussion to shorten the time, mid-September
was settled upon.</p>

<p>"Oh," Daffodil said in her most adorable tone, "I
shall pray daily that nothing will befall you, that God
will send you back safely to me."</p>

<p>"And I shall be praying for you. Love surely
opens one's heart to God."</p>

<p>There was not much to be made ready. The girl
laid aside this and that for the son's wife when he
should take one, "for," said she, "there is so much
in my new house already. And Felix must marry
young, so you will have a new daughter in my place."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span></p>

<p>She would not be married in church nor wear the
olden wedding gown. "Let it skip a generation,"
she said, "and that may change the luck."</p>

<p>So the time came and the lover so full of impatience.
She would have the ceremony in the old room
that had been so interwoven with her life, and she
fancied the spirit of great-grandfather was sitting
there in the old chair and she went for his
blessing.</p>

<p>The little girl passed out of Old Pittsburg and left
behind lonely hearts. Grandad could not be reconciled,
there were some fine young fellows in the town
that would make good husbands. But Norah gave
her a blessing and the best of wishes. So Daffodil
Bartram went out to her new life, wondering how
one could be so glad and happy when they were leaving
behind so much love.</p>

<p>Old Pittsburg did not vanish with the little girl,
however. But she went on her way steadily, industriously.
The new century came in with great acclaim.
Shipbuilding prospered. Iron foundries
sprang up. The glass works went from the eight pots
and the capacity of three boxes at a blowing to double
that number, then doubled it again. The primitive
structure erected by George Anshuts before the century
ended was the progenitor of many others sending
their smoke defiantly up in the clear sky. And
all along the Monogahela valley as well as in other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span>
places the earth gave up its stores of coal as it had
given up its stores of iron.</p>

<p>And in 1816 Pittsburg was incorporated as a city
and had a mayor and aldermen and her own bank.
It was a new Pittsburg then, a hive of human industry,
where one business after another gathered
and where fortunes were evolved from real work, and
labor reaps a rich reward.</p>

<p>There are not many of the old things left. The
block house built in 1764 by Colonel Bouquet still
stands. A great depot covers the site of the ancient
Fort, and the spot of Braddock's defeat. But there
are Duquesne Heights, all her hills have not been
levelled, if most of the old things have passed away.
She is the workshop of the world now, one writer
calls her "the most unique city in the world." And
she has not neglected the finer arts of beautifying.
She has magnificent buildings, fine libraries, and cultivated
people, musical societies, and half a hundred
benevolent institutions. And we must not forget that
in six days after the firing on Fort Sumter a company
of Pittsburgers marched to Washington and
offered their services to the secretary of war.</p>

<p>If the little girl had vanished, Daffodil Bartram
found much happiness in the new home. M. de Ronville
was not only delighted, but grateful over his two
children who were not of kindred blood, but of the
finer and higher kin of love. There came children to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span>
the household, three boys and one golden-haired girl,
but he did not quite reach the years of his friend
Duvernay. And when the two older sons were grown
they cast their lot with Allegheny City, which in the
course of time grew into a lovely residential city, free
from smoke and dust and noise, and theirs proved a
noble patrimony. The Bartrams still had a son and
daughter, and the journey to Pittsburg no longer had
to be made in a stage coach.</p>

<p>Felix Duvernay Carrick made one of the notable
citizens of the town, the author of several useful inventions
and a most thriving business man, not needing
any of his sister's fortune, for grandad left him one,
beside the one he was making with his brains and
industry. And Barbe was a happy grandmother to a
merry flock, but she would never leave the old house,
though the farm was cut up by streets and houses
crowded in upon them. And she kept her bed of
daffodils to the very last.</p>

<p>If there was not so much romance, it was the old
story of the Rhinegelt of the land and the rivers
yielding up such treasures as few cities possess, but
without the tragedy of their legend. Work and thrift
and the ingenuity of man have reared a magnificent
city.</p>
